yes , good day mean , ladies , gentlemen .
very much . thanks for the references here today .
and i have to me , now -- imagine .
my name is christian <unk> and i am , even term , <unk> at the city .
that are called <unk> for eight years .
and my <unk> is : one staff , two , the organization , and thirdly , the public policy .
so i 'm for the <unk> this city , accountable .
and yes , that makes you do n't quite popular .
i know .
and beyond this , and that 's what my son , particularly like , i also <unk> .
that means that i 'm the head of the <unk> fire .
<unk> <unk> and a kilometer <unk> .
and have i thought , is obviously a subject matter , i do you today <unk> want .
because with the subject of <unk> , because this is also heard the firemen .
we hope for the best and for us on the worst , and that has jack that once said .
you know him .
he was once in general <unk> .
and then i start something not very much like serious obligation to say .
i <unk> you a position .
so we talk , if it 's a risk , there , that we briefly in front of a stand for example , <unk> <unk> , the rush .
many people are the way .
it being , does it <unk> .

nobody seems to belong .
the suitcase heard any subject .
suddenly an <unk> .
leave you that <unk> .
the police comes , fire , <unk> .
people are .
these <unk> .
go out there .
what 's because this ? , asking passersby .
we realize that we also not or we ca n't it 's say .
the people leave the building .
and cry .
some of may actually , because it all very quickly go to .
a sudden , who failed .
there 's <unk> inside .
a panic is breaking out .
i am now here on .
the rest of bastards . i your imagination .
but it 's no fantasy , that i <unk> . <unk> ?
this is this , in this week , what happens in <unk> .
there 's such a suitcase can be some of them .
afterwards she turned to start out , that only , in <unk> , nine billion pounds of drugs at it .
but the people were just like , and that has a friend told me that tells , from the building , you .
it was n't told .
and it was that same kind who of at least in the group , the my friend in the my friend , i found myself .
god is thank you is n't panic that have , otherwise would all that we are not so safe to run out how it .
you see , in a descriptions , in a <unk> disaster is to communicate , a very important .
communication is so important , because the people at this is literally to communicate <unk> .
they want to know , which is because we go .
they used in the good , old was time that for the authorities , still pretty simple .
we 've just ca n't have said , or we 've got lied .
why ?
because it 's called the <unk> and there .
you have to start with this fair to say , god , the people get in panic , say we would n't like the truth or we say the <unk> .
this is in a time the social media , in a time of twitter , in a time of facebook , in a time of private and public <unk> , in a time of private equity and public television is not more possible .
just and intense that because it 's one is not that 's and secondly , are doing anyway , we the past when the agency , the over the event to report .
you remember wondering , maybe even at the one in the hudson river , is a year , here .
the first reporting that came at twitter .
of someone , the things in ferry over was and just and emotional , tweeted , here 's a plane <unk> and we save the people now .
this was no <unk> .
you see , we 're dependent on , today , `` and intense of the first place , the truth to say , and very <unk> to inform them .
because usually we 're obviously also the past , the supposedly swinging the fact you know , because we want to do n't have of course , to pay attention , that we just <unk> information to pass .
that are public media , or , private media , either ca n't pay so that , or they do it also not .
of so , we 're going in the food , and that 's also something that even by the media has gone are , we think about how we in the future with <unk> deal .
and we going to the good old siren , back out .
however , just as a form of <unk> .
that means we 're in the next few years about a hundred siren , in the <unk> build , the , some of you know that still , <unk> , if it 's room for <unk> coming .
once it was so .
you may know they still , three times in short , even mention briefly , once a long and even just means .
i know it .
we 're going to the world today is suburban development , with all <unk> , that we need to take this point have , so <unk> , of facebook , over onto twitter , over the radio <unk> , at night , over the tv and all over the internet and the local media and so , and immediately , to the course , with <unk> , to end of the information on to get .
and we know , we have there 's very quickly and <unk> operate and we have there 's very quickly and <unk> out , because the zones , and citizens to be otherwise , insecure .
and we ultimately , not more i think that , what we tell you want .
communication in the crisis , or in the disaster is so one in a question of the rapidity of all media , the available to us stand , and it 's also a question of adoption .
the credibility that 's our biggest problem , because the zones , and citizens to say , either , oh , the proportion time again , right , it 's not , or they say , the <unk> us , it 's all very much worse than it in reality is .
we have therefore , good experience to be done with facebook and twitter , still in .
also that you may have some of in them on the media from .
we have a <unk> in the food <unk> had .
and it 's a call these chemical bomb .

the problem is just , many of these hydrogen bombs -- i 've never works and that , like , in <unk> one of the in the food <unk> .
and we were from one elderly gentleman , the be a conscience , he 's so beautiful in the turnaround , easier to , we were now , he had seen as you <unk> forty-three like it 's and now <unk> , he has the authorities to be misinformed , that 's a bomb on the ways . laughter in the background .
the way since i have to several older , the cases in the whole <unk> .
we 'll see , what we still find everything .
these hydrogen bombs to immediately , place , not have defused the will , but in fact .
and so then we have in <unk> park , which simply and intense an , in every sense of the word , a bomb , gloomy .
and the first time in the history of the city around the communications of facebook and twitter is going to let me with the consequence , that the <unk> far over <unk> <unk> 've followed .
and the media was thrilled . laughter in the background .
we had n't even with those of telephony , but that have <unk> and <unk> , all over <unk> and twitter .
all this was a great effect for us , because the credibility that will do is increased about these social media .
just so , they have to me also a sign that there , when i 'll stop to .
i can go from this is not at the clock , check .
this is the credibility that , because the first of these social media , the advantage we have , that you very much information to pass .
it 's not very <unk> are , because the members that there are or the <unk> , how they called , a high <unk> .
secondly , we 've done .
if anything not true , writes that anyone responded immediately , so the adoption , of the i just talked to have , and rising , because of the entire community , at the reports that there is .
and it 's a very high <unk> so , so if anything that 's wrong , it 's very fast as you correct .
and we have a huge <unk> .
i said yes , <unk> it to find indeed , as a bomb , <unk> park , up goes .
of so we 've come from all the things , the in the last years happened are , and it are much more <unk> happens as intense an still think , as intense in a third .
also the food can every day of such a home for unlocking .
a bomb , the in fact to be in a park , is certainly not such a .
but they can also , after <unk> we now , in <unk> be found , and then i am , we see there with our <unk> and try to the in seven meters deep <unk> .
and if the , if you see in munich , you think to other cities , if the then the fact to , because you just something called a <unk> has , you have conventional or not to defuse that can , then we know , right now , be a variety of houses each and speed . so look like before .
and that to communicate it 's important , one hand , because it 's in a in a world <unk> <unk> which is necessary , communication to the idea , to leave you also to panic now inevitable , to try to worry about to wear , that people of these are , to try to worry about to wear , that people in the fields that are actually , on these difficult situation work .
and the social media to help us as well , because , to be , because ultimately , they all the communications are involved , and it 's not just a <unk> <unk> is how we play in the <unk> , <unk> and certainly , still in the <unk> for large part of occasion .
of so now is <unk> not only one task , the authorities , not only one task of fire or the <unk> , of <unk> , the <unk> , red cross etc. , but about communication in the catastrophe , overcoming adversity , a catastrophe about us all .
and <unk> this has shown .
there 's about twitter and over from a lot of the help the time , if we also partially destroys you still with the kind was , because suddenly <unk> of people in any <unk> build wanted , and you know what does n't anymore where the <unk> .
this is also , there 's still much to do , for the public communication in <unk> , but the unprecedented amount of solidarity with the <unk> and of suburbia , has just shown that the social media from a <unk> , from a communication to do n't even more to think are .
and i hope , that i do you a truly believe that have , that this media , that yes , for the beautiful things of life often is used , in <unk> its meaning and purpose it , and that we as a city , the for the for the <unk> charge is , this instrument , in the future , still very new , and very different definitely going to her , to the citizens to use the zones , and citizens and so the end i now , and thank me very much for your attention , when i do you have the time , barely seen .
thank you .
so , a beautiful good evening .
i 'm <unk> different .
i 'm a writer and <unk> , as you just have heard .
and i 'm now , still , a own <unk> to start moving .
what it is , i was there <unk> make me , that i 'm also give them in a few years ago .
before i do that , i must but a few things <unk> .
the first is , , i think , that we are really to live longer need .
that we no stories that i could live .
and i believe that , very much more <unk> , <unk> , <unk> stories , there , as of the entertainment business actually produced locally .
then i think about locally , that the internet , the infinite and then , of fact that well as anybody <unk> really neat <unk> of .
and fourth , i 'm <unk> believe that , that people that were created , to be creative .
and that you happier lives are , once you to be creative people can .
the more people are happy , the better , it 's the world .
very obvious .
these better world is now , just a byproduct .
in the first line , i am , already said , a storyteller .
and the story , that i tell you want , starting to midnight poised in a affinities and , in the just happy <unk> it will .
this is <unk> .
and it 's <unk> <unk> birthday .
now get them from the disposition and the singing it 's not that much with , because in the moment . it strikes midnight 's gone , something happens with her .
it 's something in your mind , in your body , with their perception .
and they did n't really word for .
they do n't know , what 's just happened .
i , word for .
i call that the wizard of <unk> .
you see the one side <unk> and toto in <unk> and everything is pretty stark white .
i 've got madd '' feeling that i am somehow felt pretty <unk> .
<unk> .
and the other side , we 've got the two , then the country of oz -- with very very much color .
and it was at this point in the first , that i 'd better <unk> and writing , that i 'm drawing .
so , the first , what <unk> now with their new perceptions , you see , is a stranger , man with <unk> <unk> hair , the ago , it says , you very seriously at , and says , very much , congratulations , your life is over .
this is <unk> .
and <unk> educates <unk> about , that you to a very special kind of people heard .
they became a <unk> born .
are people , the ab your <unk> have to her lifetime , play .
of you who knows <unk> ?
nice .
imagine if you , the <unk> at <unk> n't swords , if you go together meeting , but <unk> from the pocket .
so these cubes , <unk> , <unk> , anything possible .
what really important is , the players have no insight on their <unk> .
we know , yes , not , when we die .
i wish is in a long life , but we know it was n't .
it can make tomorrow also all already passed .
and so , it 's in my players , so .
they do n't actually , to how much you because actually can play .
that means , again , every lost full minute could the last been to be .
a player , of his entire lifetime , we think has , <unk> the moment of <unk> as a candle that <unk> of .
now you can do to natural wonder : if that because this is dangerous , why are the then all ?
the answer is very clear : that .
without play , without any players to a around , <unk> , all of gray , and only when a player does , he 's actually alive .
that were to play born .
so .
this story of <unk> and how you 're now the world , the players <unk> , your first challenge is , and of course , inevitably , <unk> love , this is the story , that i tell you want .
and it in form of a <unk> .
the first season has 12 of course , sorry , i 'm here is a <unk> happens , which i just too late to see .
so , 12 , in the first season , with a total length of each spent five to seven minutes .
this kind of <unk> , a result , after the other , beautiful <unk> told , that you know .
that television . do for his <unk> nothing else .
this is not new .
and if it all be , if only ' i now , first time . it .
and what does not here .
now let 's but , we .
we go still need to even <unk> back .
what 's the most sentence of the movie or from the pbs series ?
it can only one there , right .
thanks .
as if we practiced that have .
and that is slapping on my players , which is not to .
of which is it very very many , there .
there 's so many different games .
it you just to <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and so , and so on .
and that <unk> 's also the number of gamers .
and so that 's a lot of stories , the all be told you want .
now would be the next question : who is because it all share ?
i ' have a fairly huge amount of opinion of me .
i 'm giving me for sufficient smart and extremely creative .
but i know , that 's a hundred brain . is producing as just one , it 's mine .
so it came right to the idea , that you the crowd , in the process of pulling .
what would , if we <unk> not just how we worship , or give free , but even <unk> ?
so if you say , we invite you very very much a , the development of this <unk> with the thing .
imagine if you , for example , in the result , three diving into a <unk> on , they really neat to find , because he would you know , at her grandfather of them .
and they 're a giant fan of <unk> .
then you can now just , with the modern technology is that yes , not far more so hard , a <unk> do .
and that they invite the <unk> up , where it then straight , and this is really cool <unk> , the really interested in the audience that will .
that is , it 's not anywhere from the top , but it goes into the right there , where it up to .
this really nice thing is , we the internet .
and the internet , you ca : yes , really do anything .
so , every medium is kind of the light .
that means you as viewers , you can write , drawing , turn , what we also , they do want .
and if we now , again this structure through .
that looks <unk> bit of <unk> net , right ?
so this <unk> , what common set up .
and i 'm really <unk> believe that , that the internet was born in the right of these stories to tell .
it make it , still not so many , or at all that none .
so , `` okay , i but even odder still a step further and making the audience was have to the player .
because in a <unk> .
because you to become characters from the pbs series meeting , against people in the real environment , the number as these <unk> on your phone .
phrases here , that you know how are also all very well , are something like , mobile <unk> and <unk> <unk> entertainment .
this wonderful , which the , just very rapidly developing .
and the i do n't take it , because i do over again , 20 minutes i 'd need .
we take root again .
everybody 's time , there 's made of three parts .
the first part is the <unk> , the second part is the <unk> and then we have the <unk> .
with this <unk> i could before the jury of , right now , i got this is about to detect , the <unk> innovation <unk> convince them .
the have to me as the price for the best <unk> there .
and i 'm going to say , these jury was all of officials from the bank , of the <unk> , <unk> and so forth .
so good people , you want to my .
and when i the convince you can , here with my : the internet right , and narrative structures to revolutionize tax , the way , still better world , i think , i can actually , we do .
so .
everybody 's time you : why is the whole , that ?
because i 've left alone in the names all areas i covered .
we have of course , first of the <unk> , who 's on it , i 'm on it , you 're on it , everybody 's time .
now , then that die .
in the pbs series of it 's very much would die .
everybody 's time you mean , everyone needs to time to die .
and then of course also , everybody 's time running in terms of everyone can be part , if it do want .
this is me , really important .
i come , from the <unk> and there 's nothing worse , i think , as if it 's a <unk> of .
i do n't know , if you know that you know .
if you in which are and then it 's the actor , so in the auditorium and all this : oh god , please , not me .
and this is it 's not .
so it 's kind of interaction .
and nobody has to .
he can also just the viewer can be .
the reason why i german , speaking is the , that the entire project , in german will be , why do n't .
that has also a few reasons .
i 'm with this project <unk> while the way , and i was , and wondered : go all this , but in english , they 're the bigger , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and i can not just say , the german <unk> is the third of the world .
the <unk> is the english , then it 's the spanish , and then the german .
now it 's not so , when i would we in some little by moving .
and i think it actually really , if it also other people that 's like me , that people to be grateful to be for something , that 's not by any <unk> <unk> was , where the bottom and then everybody <unk> and every pun <unk> been reclassified .
if that everything that 's , i do it would have , then goes to the result now the first in <unk> online .
and if you now you ask , why i 'm here at a <unk> , where it , under the headline <unk> worth , <unk> .
and i also a couple of the time .
i love <unk> .
not just <unk> .
i 'm also quite on the amount of <unk> and <unk> .
a few <unk> were also , and <unk> .

but it uses , it 's nothing , there 's not apply them .
and my project is just <unk> thing where i just passed , all taken of have , what i like we 've learned .
and it applied .
and so far is that 's good .
i can really just say .
so , if you now , anybody thinks , i want to have been my part that , i had 19 degrees ' one idea <unk> character or i ' a drawing <unk> cartoon , or what 's also always , that 's also have already now .
you find us , the internet .
on facebook .
well , as freely in the thing to talk .
yes , <unk> ' i also .
welcome to , you can study memory process ?
question to you .
you can study memory process ?
can you because at all remember , in your life ever happen is ?
have no . <unk> mind ?
who has who can be wondering , still at all remember that ?
it go to do n't .
so you 're living memory process ?
apparently been .
thank you .
no , it , we want that 's us today is n't do .
and then i would be the talk to get some pretty quickly .
let 's good evening , my name is samuel <unk> .
the talk today , tonight , i 've chosen , because he 's two of my passions , or my two great love down at connecting .
i , very here in the near the computer science , studied and i did , let me just with the bits and of bytes of busy , the world today is so large prints through the world .
and <unk> certain time i 'm now , as a coach , consultants , in the private and professional capacity in the way .
the one side and i so , with the computer very much too , the other side , i 'm now it in the in the human <unk> <unk> <unk> , so how does that one that the human beings ?
how do you because that change ?
the to a statue of these two .
i was recently in a very interesting discussion of artificial intelligence , <unk> <unk> .
so , the question was : when we can , when , when we can build a computer , the way it works like the human brain ?
so , and i think , there are we 've gotten pretty close .
so i think , so two , three hundred years , no longer need that .
but they will let me , do , why you that 's why that maybe <unk> little kid needs .
so the comparison directly between the computer on the one side and our brains to the other side .
if we the computer taking , then based , everything , so your smart , the tablet , you <unk> and also these cameras and all of intelligent refrigerators somewhere on <unk> little chip .

those are all of <unk> transistors .
the word has certainly have any of and in <unk> it will always like a triangle , and the arts .
this <unk> little device , that has three ports , and forth a power , or not .
in our computer in our cpu , we have , i ' work extra <unk> ago about five hundred million of these little pieces .
and the turn it 's just mess .
we save this stuff , we 'll figure things , we have degrees ' you with albert einstein always tell you hear , 'n computer can do anything you can be very much , very quickly , but actually , it could just zero and one that .
more he ca n't .
he 's actually quite made me .
we want that 's time you compare with our brains .
our brain has as the smallest unit of the neuron , the neuron , and we have them , because i <unk> , a hundred billion , and a hundred billion neurons are in our of gray structure up here .
this beautiful but is , our our neurons have not only three fundamental connections , but that have to <unk> a neuron .
and that makes a <unk> <unk> of , just because it 's beautiful , is about 10 trillion .
that are 10 to 14 zeroes <unk> .
so , because you see , the complexity of the brain is to make a higher than that , what we are still a computer .
we want to the <unk> time for contrast , maybe the a or other people know of , the first supercomputer that had their own power station on are , ha that were , and with the <unk> the <unk> was the campus , there <unk> .
our <unk> <unk> sometimes it , but the box up here it takes about 20 watts .
and of is , and this is , the equivalent of two big selling bananas , so more you do n't and her , she 's showing up there 's wonderful .
if we now <unk> landscapes -- good part up here , <unk> landscapes -- good calculator with <unk> , why we 're using the then not , why we remember that we then things ?
maybe you know the one or another this out in the internet , so , the person , uses only 10 percent of the brain , buy you 're now this <unk> to the <unk> brain .
and <unk> 's wrong . in a little .
ten percent , perhaps , but our brain is yes , over our evolution to this mass retarded growth , that was , <unk> smaller , very in the middle of us is still our <unk> with the inside , anything other has to <unk> educated .
this is n't happen , because we do n't that we use .
why it seems to then that we the most part of <unk> let me ?
maybe you know , the term of the pun here ?
of i compared ' heels of , so beautiful with the iceberg , if you the iceberg , see , in the ocean , is the top so the top , then there 's the ocean , there 's a <unk> .
and these 10 percent up , that are that 's about this , what our sense , our <unk> mind is , <unk> goes , nine-tenths percent , which is a giant <unk> , <unk> .
we <unk> the point of that we <unk> we <unk> we <unk> we <unk> <unk> slow but we <unk> creative .
and the time <unk> on this memory back , maybe you know the one or other people with <unk> memory .
people , the , suddenly on a lot more detail it can remember when i do n't seen . i ' in the situation <unk> , and the tell you then <unk> , i ' said yes , yet , but , where you know that ?
this is , there 's very , there 's a particular , called a <unk> , so anybody with <unk> , somebody the most in a field <unk> , the excellent treatment is , the has a so good <unk> memory , the 's been in a plane , he got , in a plane , in a helicopter , so fast is , he then ow , not , over rome effectively went , has to rome to view , so rome that is yes , now . ow , not necessarily the city , has , after a giant planetarium , signs of faith to and has started , rome to draw .
and it 's not a way , so here , so the river , and there is , that , no , every home , every single door , and every window has he once seen , and it has <unk> , it could be back to paper into .
where is now that ?
so why ca of this , why we ca n't that , well , that he 's also be a very close , that the <unk> bit more access , in its nine-tenths of the craft .
now we 're using the yes , but why i can now , not at the at the <unk> last night , remember , in the details of ?
'n <unk> <unk> of me has to find interesting about what 's done .
he has even for example , in the been working and has to a rape survivor who worked , that had her experience is completely eliminated , this was n't even more mind , that <unk> <unk> the brain , that 's not going on , that 's gone .
it , it was the very well , right .
now went , but it , and <unk> .
because she have in a very safe session , at the end or after this event back to be able to force , do n't even more active -- remember this was able to , they then the hallmark of the car see , in front of these people <unk> , that was not there , that was under its feet , and .
and it 's in fact , with this hallmark of the state 's a simple answer .
the second what i very well , i found , was , he has a lady in <unk> had , that has told , that her mother always embarrass her to alice in wonderland , reading , when they 're small was , so four years .
because i sat them , which resulted in your mother and her mother has been reading .
and then he has her , in a trance , goes , ago .
then she have begun to read , she was four days when they have that is , they could then still not reading , today can look at this .
and then you have has said he said , tell me , the <unk> .
they 've actually a specimen from alice in wonderland , they found , right on this side of text typed up , the lady , reading .
the brain has so this page as she was <unk> , as a picture .
after that could you read .
so , we actually have access to , but we seem to because in ordinary lives we say <unk> kind <unk> to have to us not to <unk> .
now , which , we learned not that event at about is , but how <unk> have said , he has been there 's a back a picture that , a , a a <unk> , we can store , in fact , the unvarnished world , so that , what we see , this , what we smell , that , what we hear , that , what we taste and that , what we feel , hey , if you 're now <unk> at a yellow lemon , thinking and as you , right <unk> <unk> , you have <unk> sense , of smoking tastes , very popular example .
and , it was now <unk> long tonight , put them , but <unk> comfortable , ha , <unk> bit above and , you can i ask you , by showing you , just passed , very quickly affects your eyes .
and remember , a very 're , one incident in the recent past , yeah .
they take the first , what comes .
and , if you that now do , going to you might notice , that you to this memory of a visual part .
they get , maybe a picture , a movie ?
some of that did n't start on , because we 've felt that normally do , but that they do all the first time i realized that .
and if you see that , it be , that they 're either in the movie revenues are , from their eyes , all experience , or how you try to see themselves on a canvas .
this one that we call <unk> , the other <unk> .
thank you , they 're allowed the mind back to solve , to the eyes peering back up .
who has , because a visual information , at hand up ?
yes , there , but <unk> ' a few hands up , that 's so , 'n two-thirds of what i would say , that 's about this , what i expected to have , it 's it 's actually something that we so often do , that it gives us in the first moment , not sure .
well , ' <unk> on .
<unk> what we also is beautiful at . their memories , if you memories <unk> , is yes , not just that memory , up , <unk> <unk> feeling that , we <unk> a positive that event and i , the one or other people who see , there was so , that was beautiful , there were , yes , they laugh , is the memory that may still there , in fact , which we do with memory , beautiful or other feelings .
and now here 's what 's exciting .
<unk> anything but it was , well , the brain is power , in , no difference between what we actually remember , and the , what we just imagine , what we could color .
also that you can try out , if you to home <unk> down and wondering , something in the future , imagine , that still not happening is , they are similar information into how do something , if , something i remember , what the past .
and , , you know , but when you are these stories , that you so here in social situation round , of time .
then , because this happen and that , and that was so beautiful , and ever known for those stories behind , more beautiful are mostly the stories , hey , there were the people still a lot of drunks , there was the evening . it was a situation , there was the sunset we still a lot of romantic , there was the waterfall is still much higher .
if we mean , in retrospect , do , so if we really our memories that change , why do we do that does n't take action , i 'll ask them ?
<unk> , when i came down here , has to me my uncle is a picture that , of his hut and in switzerland .
a very nice image , it 's also a very shack .
it , this picture is nothin ' <unk> bit more than the shack , so it 's artistic depiction of freedom , did he told me , well , there 's the shack <unk> bit around , there is nothin ' 'n bit more of grass verge of , there 's a beautiful dog that , by the sun in the alps , this is quite a picture of the shack , not to make .
and why do we do that 's not with our own thoughts , our own external memories , hey , what it bothers me , because , when i think that still more fun doing , at what i think it 's degree i think ?
they 've actually make a freedom and in their own thoughts .
<unk> you know , so some people , that you see the morning , if you just like the gray have eyes , which is because this ?
yes , i ' thing you 've made , i went around the <unk> through the head .
really all the night and this idea of made me not anymore .
i think it 's way around the he made the idea was n't go .
the son <unk> friend of me <unk> little depressed , when he went to germany was , because his mother in <unk> stayed stagnant and he has they just awful missed .
what the father has done , so he has to each night , he sat down , and has said , or has been wondering , so , what was that most beautiful , what 's happening today ?
what was that most beautiful , use in the time , and then he has led him tell you can make , has it <unk> let , has it just tell you can make , which is good happened .
and , within two weeks went 's the son was doing great .
and then it was also okay , that -- way is , the coming , back to visit .
and the is the has that all the youth of made of the is one of the <unk> people , that i know .
it so there are not the memories , the us to influence . , how we are , but it 's our focus on , our focus on the idea that we use .
and how much energy we rely on around , or use .
so if you <unk> <unk> thought <unk> or say , , that was today , now . ow , that 's so , <unk> this centuries-old practice , but i really not , you do you , like , you might tom cruise in this <unk> fiction now , he has this , that these <unk> computer , where he did the files <unk> <unk> , they do that , but also time , they looking for her image , that <unk> have this , well , not very much like . one of a have , they say , well , <unk> now <unk> happens , but , zack , way that .
so ham , we because <unk> ' yet , ah , is a fine , yes , look over time , <unk> , yes , that has to me <unk> ' real , like , man , that was that was beautiful , well ?
and then they take this , with .
they take this with in their <unk> and you make this work .
or if you know somebody <unk> in good , <unk> , it <unk> their their boss , or your wife , or her husband , <unk> , and they <unk> .
so , take them , this image that , put them <unk> funny hat on , hey .
<unk> <unk> <unk> with <unk> , let them in the background horses jump , yes , they laugh , why you get them ?
because they <unk> imagine , because of thinking funny .
and you can be much better with the occasion , suddenly we deal .
ca : man memories so voting process ?
no , i think our brain has been so much greater capacity , that 's all that can .
it does , but nothing , because we can free to vote , how strong , we focus and how important , we make an event , a memory , a thought , the rate , it comes on us .
my plea to you , at them , you play with the images in your mind , they use the power of your element , and they give him every day <unk> , the their lives now .
yes , the good afternoon .
thank you for the references .
if i in a party asks me , what i like in my spare time doing , and tell , that i got together with friends , a <unk> <unk> and up , i see is shining eyes and in the head of my audience around the <unk> of the dancing crowds , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> come up .
if i then <unk> , that it happen in the film festival , to a film festival , classical music is , then we say , in those dancing crowds of the old people , the in now , long <unk> in <unk> of sit and very focused on the art , listen .
frank zappa once said , about music to talk is so how about architecture to dance .
and that wrong way that 's also , what we do .
so they still a glimpse , which i 'll talk , i put them a short film with them .
film .
there is <unk> <unk> <unk> it .
this brings it from my perspective on the best on the point .
since <unk> is that <unk> from the <unk> got out , something completely different .
we makers , are today , so forth between eighteen , and the middle , at two decades old and i have very early in our youth who experienced , which an enormous power and delight us that classical music <unk> .

and we are the , of belief that 's called the crisis the classical music , not at the content , so at the music event itself , but at their <unk> is .
so we think about the question , how we have a <unk> , that the music , the near , the friends and this force over again , there , the so that we pay so on her like .

we put the parameter that they go out of the classic concert will know , space , time , light , context , basically in the question .
we take for the relationship between the audience and musicians .
normally , there 's between the stage and the audience a gap .
we try to the pick .
here you a picture of our <unk> .
the musicians to sit in the audience , drink beer , and entertain , in the breaks down with the audience , standing on , play a , two pieces , put yourself to be back in the audience .
all this is the course of night is a little <unk> .
everybody , the like it has <unk> , from the stage , and goes back .
or that 's sitting in the concert .
in classical , concert , it 's true that you on more or less of comfortable , permanent , chairs , like you here , sits and after the look , and listening .
but there 's music , because you ca n't actually sit still .
and we 've cluttered with has done , how can this will .
if you another way to sit and it a <unk> piece of music <unk> can , you are automatically lead differently .
still socialized to come , that we in the concert does n't a stage was , but four stages of them to the audience around .
the audience could be wondering , yes <unk> .
so i was sitting at the night every once in the front row .
important for us is , we 're not only just any <unk> do , but that we of the music from thinking .
that we 're going to ask , which spaces and the atmospheres of a vague , but also in the minds of the human needs the music , that they so that can see how they are supposed to ?
and so then you get concerts by night to <unk> at 30 kilometers in <unk> , the s 's actually just of <unk> lit that are , in clubs , on <unk> , in the old <unk> .
but not just the spaces around , and the illumination can music literally alive to make and now , but the connection with other arts .
and so we are totally happy , that we 've been a few years , <unk> work together , the with us the dances , or movement to music to <unk> develop , the not actually the dance . been written about .
and so then you get <unk> for <unk> of beethoven , or for <unk> from steve the realm .
and in this year we 've gone a , yes , that if you want , <unk> too .
we have the first time a concert and with a <unk> implemented .
we have the story from the soldiers of <unk> <unk> with actors , dancers , <unk> and just <unk> to a <unk> together .
that has all , also about this works , because we have a big <unk> had , the us in this piece of the cause .
we have about a <unk> much money from people from the germans go back , so that we into could .
there is this film festival something that came from a community figured out of guises .
we 're totally happy in the ones , of <unk> in the town in <unk> a home and more .
the city is exactly that big , that we think about spaces and exciting place for concerts , , so small , that we 'll notice .
if the beginning of the year in the spring , two weeks forty <unk> out of europe in the city are , then drops on just , that in the city , more people with <unk> around as well .
the film festival is , volunteering that organized .
we makers and we 're a colorful of students and students , and doctors , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , really , which is totally up .
and to a <unk> a <unk> <unk> , that the <unk> or a coordination , and funding in your eye you keep , <unk> , seven to 10 makers in a <unk> , the for a year for a compulsory tasks are picking .
it , volunteering , but they care , for a year 's why is , for the <unk> or the <unk> , the <unk> in , of hands are and to this is organized .
we do that everybody in our time , and live in all of germany .
that is , the worst part of labor of production and on a <unk> .
just three times , make sure we all over the year is distributed to a city weekend , brainstorming , to talk about the a or other problems , the only appeared are , and for this is also interpersonal force other , that simple and important is , if you that are , to keep .
the film festival , even come and then two decades until thirty thousand volunteers , the first to , the for a few days or a few weeks of their hands to bring , and there is where do it 's needed , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> .
and of course , in these 14 days , the musician .
now you could mean , so you have anything else you for this is a film festival , needs .
but our <unk> goes further .
we have , which is in <unk> in the city a large community to us built around , so , the us support , what we want to do .
that goes from the classic <unk> go , and this is , but also about very practical things like for the <unk> , because we have a baker , of us to bread <unk> or a <unk> , of us , fresh food to make them .
this <unk> is in a barnes in the city and over the year alberto giacometti made and sells .
to the <unk> .
we have in <unk> a whole series of individuals who found , the us their living room to imagine , with the musicians and samples .
and this and it is that this to something that enable user-generated wisdom in this city has and from the people in this city .
they identify , in a very special kind and the way with this film festival .
since the beginning of the year we began to thank <unk> support of the citizens in place a <unk> into life out , the right now the entire endeavor in a sustainable and reliable <unk> turns out .
we makers in the stage , believe that classical music <unk> , provided you come in the right hands .
so we 're incredibly deeply happy about , that in all of europe , young musicians played music in your hand , let me and home at , in the cities <unk> hold .
if you now , still not that really can imagine , like that feels , classical music , like to experience , then they come , just over .
the next year we 're back in <unk> and we would be happy , if you actually , there are .
yes , ladies and gentlemen , learn .
you just think that 's favor .
you heard about this for learning or the effect of education , but i mean , to learn it 's still much more , which is also <unk> <unk> <unk> collecting and <unk> win .
you know , experience , <unk> , a formula for the <unk> .
what i think of the art and culture learned to have , well , because i can not a lot of course , to say , because now . ar : am suggesting <unk> i mean , in this field .
and so i thought , that maybe it really would , this is something <unk> called a different <unk> still need to give , what my talk <unk> .
art is beautiful , power , but much work .
they 've now , a laugh .
you get always the laughter , though the most of the saying that you know .
why is that ?
i think , that has to do with , that in the word or beautiful thing <unk> , what we 're not that really capture .
art , that we say , sometimes , that has what .
to work we 're saying that often , that has what .
sometimes .
the people , the like to work , that has to tell me .
but at work , we think more likely to the <unk> and at the art , rather on the rich , beyond one of everyday life , where we 're inside of us move , our experience in collecting , our own thoughts are .
and so i my life , which i you now you want , in about three hours in five to move into a split , the all the headline have , with a i of the beginning , so it for you very simple .
it starts with the <unk> , for the whole childhood , goes on the inspiration , for my youth , i 'm not all tell from my youth , do n't worry , then go further , the word <unk> i 'm later , why i think that for my <unk> taken .
the interaction , for the first part of my professional life and finally , fifth , positive identification .
intense one of them is this is these pieces of <unk> sebastian leave you know .
<unk> , two , and <unk> .
you learn them so in the first two , three years , if you were to practice , and i -- we practiced .
and so with 10 , 11 , i have these little bits being played , on the piano , not far from here , at the <unk> , at home .
these pieces of life of a <unk> .
there 's a melody and played and the different voice <unk> , but it 's very differently .
the rhythm is the same , but it 's <unk> .
and that , ladies and gentlemen , is something crucial to the art , that it succeeds , and if it 's only two , who are , <unk> together , together to think , if that the present , the future , the past , sometimes is , works , images , in <unk> , in your plays , things , the <unk> are , the moment to put together , this is doing art .
and i 've been with them , two distinct melodies , sometimes , three , at the <unk> <unk> , the same time to play , any kind of yet to hear , the one to highlight , the n't .
this was , what i think it 's learned to have , one of the .
a another experience , i 've never forget and i was the worry or so , it to me today may also like to be .
i piano <unk> , it was still more people in the room , here today , and in the middle <unk> i came out .
i did it 's forget .
i told her .
so again from the start , and at the same place , i did , not on .
this audience has more and sweated , almost as i , because i went in all quiet on my place , i brought my notes , put them and i started the third time of forward .
and they do n't think , like the me <unk> 've got behind .
but that was a very immersive experience .
perhaps that was also one of experiences , where i then you know , with the piano , although i then quickly as a <unk> had , i should perhaps not my spent go here , because we talk , you can be easier to cheat .
yes , the next the next chapter in my adolescence , i mean , <unk> with the inspiration and also because i want to tell stories .
when i then that <unk> was , i went to my <unk> and told him , rather , sir <unk> , i want to a <unk> play .
and he said , oliver , that 's not .
because you have to create a lot of coffee houses to have and very much of experience with women raised .
now imagine you try to time ago , a <unk> young man , so , young , like a sentence .
so , if i sort of course not forget .
and from there . i mean , more adept .
now , i was the way too . '' and to time in a <unk> .
i practiced , and i remember to a situation , that i 'd like never more experienced .
it was that <unk> of dress of chopin , and now i 'm going to the part of work , i have a 'm just do n't control , and she was with the most beautiful place , very broad you had the poor do , and then went this together again , and back apart .
i can it now , not going to play , which is not a piano , here , and i could it .
i have this place two decades , 30 times on playing and suddenly , you right .
and then i did they keep playing and <unk> , i was in a feeling ecstasy and played , and i of only still , that i suddenly on the cushions off and laughing .
i was , except me .
i did n't have been drinking , not taken , and the music has this with me that made .
an experience , where i 've learned , emotions , really allow that .
and sometimes it 's also really , we have to work , that you in this had get , in this condition , i call it , of <unk> .
where all of themselves involved .
we had this situation in fact , then in the <unk> <unk> in an organization .
there was then almost anything like of myself , when we the <unk> did , has the only half months for , where you usually a half years , i 'd need .
so , that were my experiences with the piano , with the art , with an artistic quality work .
and now i 'm going to my student , <unk> .
i was first , when musicians out , but just as <unk> .
we have <unk> played , <unk> , <unk> .
i <unk> , and have taught me , so it , next to my <unk> for the music and engage you can and that <unk> had .
in the choir singing , breathing , a <unk> singing , as a great experiences , the me very , on , enlighten .
and a point , where i as <unk> in the <unk> theater , in the <unk> went am , in the <unk> and the overhead , and i do that 's why do with <unk> <unk> , this chapter , because there for me this idea came , or this , this idea came , from this combination of art , culture , i was then , <unk> , just in the <unk> have , politics and law school , a profession .
because the art , culture to enable , to my <unk> .
so here to work for the art , but this is not as artists , but , otherwise would you , not saying <unk> , but rather than <unk> to move forward and there are going to do something .
i was there in the theater and have taught me <unk> , it was in germany , no <unk> for <unk> , just in vienna , and i did , and from there . i always more with this question about me , what you can do the art to enable , to the framework for art to improve , to a management , a good to have to create that ?
and that was the reason , why i actually , stop at the 'm in my professional lives , in towards this <unk> , and with <unk> years , i was , then <unk> .
but it was a different <unk> , and this phase i mean , <unk> with interactions .
<unk> i came to the germans <unk> .
the german <unk> has its <unk> in <unk> .
i 'm <unk> , though sometimes in my résumé , because i in <unk> was even born , it says , the <unk> oliver <unk> , about my pet , i , i got this kind of time <unk> .
but i mean , a <unk> root , because my maternal grandparents were also <unk> <unk> , and there , in <unk> , i have the carnivale experienced .
this was i 'd like something that i 'm not so the privilege of have , and suddenly i was sucked in a different form of culture , in a <unk> , in a culture , that lived by one of people in this in this <unk> device of <unk> .
once the carnivale on us coming , were all in a very different situation , in a very different states .
and i 'm going to <unk> <unk> , the future <unk> and <unk> <unk> , of my friend and it was , then we have always for the <unk> the music done , he 'd be , i piano , still a different has a bass -- played , for example , i was at her <unk> .
we have the <unk> <unk> done , so , but obviously keen on the text of <unk> <unk> , for months , if you .
and this carnivale , that was really from the people out .
it was my destiny , that i the ninth november <unk> for my <unk> learned and i <unk> not begin with , the wall fell .
i was the next day , i was oral exam , oh , the wall is like , yeah .
have taught me more quickly come prepared to , in any questions for <unk> .
and ab : there was i <unk> for the cities in the east germany .
and it 's where i again , you know , interaction as they 're going to be between two germans cultures .
so we talk the same language , the music is there , wonderful and was a wonderful played , but many things that was <unk> , <unk> .
different than the carnivale it was not from the people all of myself , but it was a lot of the top , and that i do when a big addition , it felt , here to experience , like the german , as well , that i 'll see , which times more time back , slowly , very broken , and the german <unk> then these two states , connecting .
since is germany , <unk> .
since is also on the federal much more <unk> , places .
so i then , but , all things here we learned and i know , in the city .
we have of the first place that i had actually a <unk> , imagine if you time ago , when i 'm here 's started , <unk> , stood on my <unk> <unk> for culture and play .
i have the .
and play for was <unk> , you do n't want to write <unk> for culture and <unk> .
i was looking at the first board of <unk> .
so i play which is not so much so , was that 's wonderful , that i these <unk> had , but they disappear soon , because i then for education in charge and was going to make alliances , education do and design .
we have very much for the urban studies done , we have the if you only time that the analog between <unk> , <unk> and <unk> see , what we there is able to have , the <unk> experience , <unk> , where you interactions between works and architecture can see that we can , from <unk> to <unk> at the blue one of stones .
many , again , we were and i could actually designing and i experienced , and the time , what this , if different people from different areas and a target to track .
they memorize the way , that i always more <unk> of the art , more , the culture , the us is , the us the scientific unifying between humans , between cultures , between those communities , , i should in the view them and i come , but afterwards the art .
so this was also then the <unk> the subject as we , <unk> , seven <unk> the idea was , the would be , january <unk> , that <unk> could be wondering , to the <unk> europe -- .
but that last chapter , this one fifth one chapter one has yet the headline of identification .
this word has , two primary meanings , for one , i misimpression by me with something , <unk> me so to something , and i put it , but also as verb use and say , i misimpression by something , that is , i know something .
and it 's always in his <unk> .
i know something to <unk> , so i say , i misimpression you , or the or that community .
and i misimpression by me with something , when i 'm going to <unk> and say , that you wanted to me , i want to identify .
and that 's a very big action .
five billion point three million people trying , to move , <unk> cities , to identify the double coupons and so , to <unk> and to see , that you a community is in europe .
as big , we have it then <unk> called , but anyway , as a community of many people , the in a big farmland , life and yet at least a common language to talk , <unk> nations are here and this was our key frontier , the positive identification , to start with the people and of you course , too much the ride .
at the signs , the <unk> the highway , many other experiences .
an experience of the <unk> . i have not so many people around .
there , ham , has <unk> <unk> and eat , two schools , worked , young girl from <unk> that <unk> , and boy , students from a <unk> school , from <unk> <unk> , have letter of people , young men , from <unk> to a play the data , the home , say goodbye , love , death , the last letter writing .
and it was already a special effect , that young girl who have letter from young <unk> up and boy , the russians and then the letters of young men from germany in a visibly german .
and there sits down , one of these young men , in the piano , and he played this <unk> , which i so loved .
and in dutch ) oh , who he made of a letter , and said , i 'm <unk> , he wrote him to home , as young german , he was , and i ca n't even more a <unk> play , because my my two fingers on <unk> .
and he <unk> his finger , with a <unk> , sat down , again , in the piano in that play on <unk> carl , and tried , the <unk> to play .
and it did n't show him .
it was for me like a <unk> scene , that i 'm going to jump forward off am , i said , what we actually have learned ?
we 've learned , in the <unk> , that many people together to move anything can , but , all things we 've learned that we sixties , in <unk> in peace of life and the culture that comes together , that we do n't even more than the minds go , because we different languages to talk , that we need to identify , to us , i feel .
and that was for me a wonderful experience and you see , it goes to learn not just about , something to know .
it 's the learning , that , something to learn and <unk> .
and if we 're much up and invention , there , <unk> , if we let it , that we inspire and let 's kind of art and culture , our own right position to relate , in a dialog with the artwork , if we interact and finally , at our own identity , working , we faced with art and culture and ask , let me , then we all have won
and i hope is , they still many <unk> and <unk> have , from where they are those profit .
thank you .
yes , thank you .
i think , we wait on the first picture of ideas .
so i have to <unk> to support my memory is that 's a few slides <unk> .
it are , but no scientific slides , but it goes in my <unk> here 's why , a way to find and i do with a topic either way through , where i think , that 's going to the next few years very significant implications are .
by the <unk> words , i know now finally , thank you that , what ted , i mean , and i think , in <unk> we can this talk about an arbitrary .
and then i was still have heard , that you the talk , in english , i think we should , if it possible , but , if you look at it , then you see , they would n't understand , what i in english to say , i did n't know , right , i do it to say , and so , what i talk , then , but in german left .
how we will die .
i have to them because the first of <unk> tell you .
<unk> was a patient in the hospital . i the <unk> <unk> , and was bringing down .
she was about , nine-tenths of years old and has always like in the may , dance , because they do this also at her husband who reminded , the first man , the in war like it was then .
and that 's them every year for the first of may to dance , you go and has been a dance and probably even then a <unk> <unk> to a lot to finish , and then is bringing down and has about is , here on the right-hand side you see this , the leg gets broken , the <unk> .
a few years earlier was they also , even slowing down and , did the same way , with equal of occasion , even the left leg gets broken .
and i was also been there as a physician and have experienced , as you weeks on the intensive care would say , as you to antibiotics that was treated , resurrects itself was , and have the discussion around , as i was , is because that sense ?
it makes no sense , in this old people like this intense , to use to stick ?
so really is , to <unk> , in the intensive weeks , like this is a people at all <unk> ?
and they then is essentially cured .
five years later i 'm going to the clinic , i see the name <unk> , and the i can all know , because he just so rare is , for the time , then , and has to the dance in the may be back the other one leg gets broken .
it turns to the question , what <unk> i think it 's actually , when i talk about , like a human for yourself to decide what to say , what he in his directives one , or what he also to <unk> which ?
and that 's a little bit about the subject of the presentation .
you see here , then the <unk> of called , how we will die .
it 's a book out of <unk> , how we 're going , a report on the <unk>
and then it was so , the globalization are very ahead was that , so you ask you have , it , because they go , connected to work ?
you have , then , and that you in this book now , still have read , just said , it 's a quality of coming , so the pieces , always fit .
it 's a -- dignity of our successes , it will also the work . it was a lot more you 're going , for example , to china , this was a big issue .
and this is actually , so come , that basically the work of individuals , so something to assemble , something to paint , having much less , ending was , that he always more control it was also of the quality , that it delivers , of the accuracy .
and that , after my prior assessment , the people 's always , confidence from their work are able , and more and part of a little <unk> were , where it was never about , and height of <unk> to do , and not more about , through his work , also to define .
and if we this now into the <unk> and medical domain of , then there 's obviously just as an evolution .
if you in television , listen , what doctors , nurses and also <unk> the most anguish , you 're 's the so-called <unk> .
and that means nothing else , when there must go for us to be , what you has done , so it <unk> is , so it even paid to , and if not going to document is , and says the health service 's also , that care or that medical treatment for we do n't .
and through these ones with is , but the work <unk> always more <unk> and more and is approaching this idea , you to his work too , and to use of personal belief compound , in the background , like a <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> .
a great friend of me is now , from holland , you go , because he said this is not anymore to , the had a <unk> practice , has the abandoned and is to the netherlands , going into the doctor for <unk> .
the <unk> are at these software development , a piece of forward and he , the martin , had just experienced , that are more and old people swing between the nursing , the hospital , and go back , because the <unk> not more you know , what they should do if it 's the people got to .
then come into the hospital , are areas , go back in my senior home , or a nursing , and be there on those loans .
and this family , did that i thought , if it that difficulties in holland , there , then i want me , like to make , to this is something that forward , that you go out of this vicious cycle of <unk> and of , <unk> <unk> of people <unk> .
there , in holland , which had it , as well , after he the language with a lot of that i 've had learned that there 's exactly the same thing happens , what transpired in <unk> happened .
it will also the dying is a quality control these practices .
it 's not anymore , the adoption , the count , but you put even in a very solid , i want for example , not be , or not the hospital , when i in a nursing am .
and then is that <unk> .
in holland , it 's so , the third day , finds a conversation with the <unk> instead , and the need to then , an issue , i want to the hospital or i do n't want more the hospital , when i think about something happened .
so just with the , i want to be or i do n't want to be .
this data , then at a central and there is this is a doctor for <unk> , has always the <unk> ago , and so then the decision in the basis .
if we now at <unk> back , the yes , like in the may , dance has and also even slowing down was , and we imagine , the have looked at a directives , people , i do n't want to be brought them , you know , they this second parachute ever danced in may have a may , where they then back down is , admittedly , not more you can experience .
and that has been my friend now , the there in holland -- is , also very much <unk> , he lies with me to do .
in the past it 's true that <unk> is about their sixties , seventy percent of people do n't even more to home to die , but in hospitals , healthcare , and that these institutions that 's , so you do that sense , not the ideals of habitats these are responsible for the old people , but it 's often a tightly to fund -- <unk> of legs , the <unk> are often <unk> and the funding to be , and for yourself to this <unk> find there , after my sense , just limited .
there 's about it , and homes , the very good about , there 's very <unk> people , the way . there are , but if i the <unk> at , and we have about <unk> patients per year , so roughly five , six , that perhaps from <unk> to us admitted to be , then i would for me say , it is hard , and getting along and be inside the self-esteem , unsustainable .
the entire course , has <unk> reasons , that 's very clearly , this whole quality , those of it 's why we introduced , because the last the money for it 's not enough , that all humans , optimal , and in the way of those are and that people , the care deliver or the medical performances that we 're paid , that they say , there was -- i well with , because i can for example , as caregivers have a family of feed with one or two children .
this is simply not the fact , but you need two salaries , in <unk> and <unk> and mostly it , just below .
this introduction of the quality control than a result of constantly up the market , you bring governance to , it , so , the individuals are affected .
and now i 'm going to say , you , maybe we can escape , so what do we now in the past , because i mean , why do n't ask for himself , and this , so very simple 's the situation for affected .
and it 's where i just this , <unk> <unk> and the article on one of me , there <unk> , because i think , a society to have always like this structure , legal structure , at that we looked at the <unk> , what happens in our society .
and in <unk> was one is just said , that would of people 's much untouchable .
and the second set up there is , you to protect it 's top of the task of <unk> .
and what i sometimes it 's missing , is still a third set in there is , which every one , to the assignment to have , he was going to protect and to defend islam .
because that a way is , to itself to be free from this case , i admit that to other way , and the to me , somehow , so , and feed , and then i need that i look at least not thinking about doing , i because even die .
because the past , it is yes , so , we this subject does n't like to ask , we are some point at the point .
hopefully will first time , with a century or <unk> .
the equivalent of course of my career as well , to say , this wish i wish everyone , i want to also to worry , but eventually , you 're going to the subject to have , and if it then maybe so far is , or , just , if you <unk> , <unk> or <unk> is , it already late in life to be late in life be , to say , i want to talk about this question now , thinking .
if you now think about , what does mean i 'd freak out , then you 're going on the dots are coming , then the last out , what are because actually the five most important things in my life has been ?
there 's now a book , what 's very , en <unk> is .
it are the self-esteem of course , it are then the friends , that i , which i go and exchange can , the know me and the me through that live with , it are the <unk> .
it 's quite sure that trust between humans , which i may also to do you have , in <unk> or the actual visits in or a pastor or a <unk> or you with other people , with that i put in the relationship , learn .
and it there are very many of factors of course , that there <unk> , i 'm the right now , not all through .

and then it comes . another factor that , that we a dictatorship in the <unk> experience , i did this of times as a text , or as a as an example of this .
other people can for us these decisions and this behavior , what 's <unk> , not meet .
this is my inner conviction .
we would be just from us even come out .
so it 's not the question , what are because others to me to do , who 's going to me , provide , for babies , or , for me , in fact , who goes on me to ?
but it 's exactly the other way , to ask , where i can on people to approach , where you can i put myself and by my inner would , having that i do with these questions that can and me . there 's position and make it .
and if you and says , how we 're going , so these internal partners that for quality , the us from the outside , put it was , it 's a way , to say , how i me about my my inner would , this mechanism to get away .
because no man can tell me <unk> , i myself , because you see , and position to .
and i have it 's also do n't fit into in general <unk> or out , the say , you have now a directives fill and because you been so old , me , i 'm going to her right , if you be brought to , if you on an icu want .
these questions , that i can be in the last only after a long <unk> probably <unk> fill prescriptions .
this would of people 's one of posture , the in me is , and the not the outside of that we can be , the the unexamined mindsets wo n't can protect , as a law , not , and that i also other people <unk> can and i 'd rather <unk> be , when i 'm just there was have done with that i asked myself have to have , so that 's also know , what i for a person , i am .
and to those conversations to lead , it 's spaces , and because i think , and that i have this talk so called , and here , over years , are those spaces like this <unk> in the food , that i you here two things tried , on a picture times <unk> , spaces , where we over these subjects to think , where a more room is , so it does n't hurt -- is , it also may not to our theory is , but that even a conversation . there 's happening .
so we , if we then the old are , it can say , oh yeah , like a dance in the may , despite my maybe at very different ages , that would still , what .
i thank you very much for listening .
on good evening .
i 'm bringing two things with .
if you the first part to go to keep you try to a little <unk>
it 's still a second .
we start with the infinite .
this is really dumb , not , can take .
what you mean ?
there 's different <unk> ?
or is an infinitely big enough ?
yes !
this is not , this one of it is , the what 's looking .
so , in the fact , but i 'll it , for the , that you know it .
and that we do n't .
we engage us with just by one .
and i limit that would like a little too . '' for a finite planet .
<unk> , a finite , we know , which we form of us a to know .
and it goes to the <unk> to the magnitude of vast amounts .
if we in a finite way are , and if you just two <unk> , in the one for example , chairs , in the other people .
we know , suppose , now , we look in the box in , the number is small , it are three : chairs and it are three people .
we can we 're checking , whether in each of the same amount of elements in it 's ?
they count , how would we do it ?
that is , we 'd just the people <unk> , one , two , three , we get the three , we count the chairs , see three : chairs , one , two , three , three and three three is three , and wonderful .
that you mean , yeah ?
nice .
this works in a finite wonderful , that you can also at large numbers , though it sucks .
but it .
how do you still had that ?
how can still need to check that , so many people like the chairs out there are ?
i realized , chairs and people and not what else .
<unk> let me !
you that 's what they mate .
you very well , that this is , not , we 're now the ground on and i have to understand that all .
not , that 's nice .
so , you call this , too much advanced a <unk> and it works as well , yeah ?
you take a , of them on a chair , from the mouse .
the next <unk> , way , the next <unk> , it 's operating , different people get different chairs , not a chair is abandoned and the amount of these are the same size , okay .
now we go into the infinity .
how do we have two large infinite amount of other than that ?
we would say , the one is that big or more or smaller than the other .
we could we do it ?
we would be back to start .
alright , that 's wrong , because the point is the , if you in an infinite , for a lot to count , i 'd passed , just say , they do n't come to another .
<unk> , forever , is , <unk> ?
so , it ?
madame ?
no way , madame .
they had but that 's really started .
they mate .
so , now we look at the time .
and guess , we estimate is the infinite always bad , yeah ?
you see , you see , no end , yeah ?
the point is what , you cook it easy .
if i for the <unk> take , those numbers , <unk> , we computer scientist who need the next to the beginning , zero , one , two , three , four , five .
and we have , we say , a copy of this <unk> and take from a piece of the infinite , you <unk> pay off .
and there are able to the just numbers , okay , zero , two , four , six , eight , <unk> ?
okay ?
all along linear numbers are <unk> on the infinite number of a long will go have the numbers , but the out a lack of the <unk> , on the others are the line , and the <unk> on , okay .
we call the a lot of the straight to pay , we call the other one of n have the numbers .
do you know ?
is , g and more powerful , it 's bigger than through n , the same size or smaller ?
in a big ?
but this is very high handling so , in the a missing , the <unk> .
who have a different about from here ?
smaller ?
who says , bigger ?
ah , that has , really do n't plan , yeah ?
this ca : yes , not be , yeah ?
you ca : yes , not , where do n't support , bigger , that 's not , <unk> ?
okay , they say , smaller ?
you 'd assume , not ?
this is the conventional wisdom , what you also suspected , course , is wrong .
and now , and now , i 'm , why the amount of the same thing .
and how does it ?
right .
yes , we mate .
this is the point .
we mate .
we take the zero from the line of , we take the zero from the natural lot , mate , out .
the next one of zero , plus two of it 's two , after the zero from the one , and i 'll get back a <unk> .
the four , the two , the six , the three , the eight , the four , yeah ?
you can it also turn back , it 's doubling , this is , <unk> ?
and completely clear that is , through the <unk> we do it , that i do it always in the lecture that 's a <unk> <unk> .
and here , there are just the straight on and the tape is a long , yeah ?
we <unk> the natural diet on the line , <unk> , the <unk> are gone , and the tape is still in a long .
that 's only in the infinite .
so if you some explain , what we have today i learned , we have become infinity learned , which is because it forever , i know , just finally ?
an infinite amount of has a property , that 's in a finite this is not and this is , is an absolute <unk> a true , a subset , the way that big is .
that make them in a finite not , if you from three three people two people <unk> , it 's only still a great , and that they were 's three .
yes , so we 've infinity .
it 's nobody had fallen asleep ?
okay .
then do we still a second part , the odds .

i did this is what brought .
with this experiment , i 'm sure , it 's at least a third , and <unk> it does anybody with , the that on it has , yeah ?
so , we call the doors , b , c .
i 've got behind anything that , i hope , you have a 's not heard .
and they should now why do n't guess .
where , you mean , i have something hidden , behind , b , or c ?
guess , here , our <unk> , here .
you appreciate , c .
who still has one another idea ?
a ?
who still has an idea ?
i 'm going , <unk> , b has been missing , not , you 'll hear the yes , never , <unk> ?
it 's right .
it 's completely ignorant about , so they have n't mean , the three , which will fall and i 'm looking for me one .
it 's really matter , yeah ?
it is yes , completely clear , because , the chance , that she has always have been blessed , is yes , jesus , just at a third .
<unk> , there 's three things , it 's really matter , yeah ?
now i am here , i 'm just one on .
well , i of course , where it 's .
<unk> , that has to anybody here , <unk> .
so , i know , where it 's , and the best guess , and appreciate that , or as you look , you do it 's called , goes in a second round .
so i 'm now really the game explain what i now , which has now , <unk> .
so it 's so , we go in a second round .
now , suppose , i <unk> me on the beta-carotene , <unk> ?
so , now i have to a door to show , behind the n't it 's and that they do n't have said .
because , if you 're now , b to say , and i say , and i know , it is yes , not the b .
then there 's yes , not a second round .
then i say , <unk> , from the mouse , one of out .
but i have to my , that 's <unk> , in the second round and go .
so i can just an open , behind the 's not only is , but what they also do n't have said .

they must now at a to stay , then i do necessarily a , on .
i 'm now that , what they want to have .
or they say , i 'm a c .
now is the <unk> , it 's now with this knowledge likely to become evolvable ?
phew , very beautiful , b is on , now i know , it 's behind , c .
or , but , god is , thanks to b is open been is , i always wanted to with a to stay , this is it .
or would you 're now say , is yet <unk> , we have , <unk> , way , we 've only still two doors , now it 's no matter , to change , or to stay .
what you mean ?
it 's not matter .
<unk> .
why it 's no matter ?
nice .
why it 's why is it <unk> ?
yes , right , that 's wrong .
this seems , almost , as if we it yesterday <unk> have , <unk> ?
but that are you , <unk> , are a new , no fun .
so , here , the thing is very <unk> , yeah .
that get all sorts between , i 'm not , six and tears , i ca n't sixties years , you can i 'll speed . part , <unk> ?
so , it get really everybody .
behind this door is it to a third .
and it 's always just to a third of a door .
they 're able to guess what they want , they have with two thirds of them in the dirt .
that is , like they can on two doors to guess not , that you ca : yes , at <unk> do , you ca : yes , two dozen put them , you 're it , <unk> , the zero , and transferred , that 's easy , everything in real life .
but here we 've just a door .
so , is now , here , two thirds of it 's no , what you guess .
so this is two thirds are here , but it can now , but just behind a door that lie !
behind the is a 's not .
so , which is then more likely ?
no way , i really have it 's hidden .
so , which is now more likely ?
it 's better , to stay , or to change ?
now it 's easy , yeah ?
yes , of course .
so , that was now not hard , <unk> ?
ha !
what we see ?
they 've got a little better .
why ?
very simple , two thirds are not a hundred percent , the difference between the theory and practice .
i hope , it was for each of what that .
thank you .
mr. <unk> , you to me , jamie oliver <unk> , the here at some of this is no diet and bad food and overweight people out how we have , this depressed as a yes , completely .
but i whistle , my best thing , that after all of the same way is , that some insights .
i come , because of <unk> farm and i knew i went to 12 signature was n't make a mcdonald 's .
that time for corporations who , yes .
yeah .
thank you for the references you today .
i 'm here in the close up .
and i do n't know , mr. <unk> , so on it came to me to ask , if i think about the ted , the seas as well i want , and over a particular topic to talk .
i 've got me <unk> <unk> : the subject of trust .
now , motivation is also not bad and i <unk> me the woman <unk> , that has said , maybe the power of a or another that there anymore , sports .
if only i also full of cancer .
so tonight is at the rain , jogging to be now <unk> a tall order , but i have to this morning in the fact , they train , because i in three weeks , the <unk> june , at <unk> , of <unk> to oslo to go to copulate with 'm half of -- that are <unk> miles .
to me , till the rain this training do n't get freed up .
so who have a ride to , <unk> , go tomorrow , early on , in <unk> , i ask me , they all welcome .
i 've got madd '' types already said , briefly , i <unk> ' <unk> the issue of trust .
and i ' , i do , with the subject <unk> .
do n't worry , the nice , little <unk> , the blind faith to come up afterwards <unk> .
i 've got madd '' before me just thought about it did , when i <unk> am , how to describe what i would be the where i <unk> ?
so , i come from 'm half the village with six ] houses , you <unk> , some <unk> and in my parents to the farm there 's an apple apples , <unk> and <unk> -- and what do you from <unk> , and beer .
trust , in sports , not in <unk> but at me , <unk> and beer .
why i could use , i the story , from where i ?
for me is one of very important stories , that i really that right from the country , the village , come , and up , i 'm with two big brothers , with the oldest one brother , the <unk> is .
and with the second half brother , the same way we think there 's how i .
i mean , the see light and dark , the can see how i just might also see , where <unk> window in space , whether it 's light at is , or out .
what is very convenient is for the <unk> .
the , we both can you see , if now , for us anything .
'n pole , but i do 'official ' , i ca n't tell , is <unk> man <unk> pole .
of the subject of the old men , <unk> .
always going to go <unk> .
and what to me , but always very was critical , is course , the fact , so you trust and you 'll just this great confidence , that <unk> , that we all need , <unk> as something <unk> situation , say , i .
and that was for my parents definitely , that you how many of them , my brother and i still not even blind to know .
we were so the first , the then , which suddenly appeared in their lives <unk> .
and then they had scavenged from the situation of what do .
and , now <unk> i , it 's a giant , that my parents than 185 farmers are not all the day long time had to us to stand and us to the hand to move or to say , there 's <unk> wall , there <unk> you , along and you can , then <unk> feel , where you <unk> .
a , that would be awkward been -- we 've always imagined that <unk> .
and b , ham , our parents of the beginning to us to them , having gone to go , where we also our sighted brother is .
so , in the home alone <unk> , the <unk> down and <unk> , it also , they risk .
there has the blind brother and i 'm going to 'm <unk> <unk> mean by , <unk> used in .
the order to the order to i have to this .
this is to the big brothers -- that are not only good for the elbow , but also for the <unk> .
and our brother and and my brothers and i we ham , i 'm a courtyard of that all troubles outside did , ma , you could do , especially for example of the driving .
and that has the <unk> brother , we are starting with three years , and then we wanted course also -- michael and i .
and have , with <unk> to go down , in many little kids , today with the wheel is that <unk> <unk> <unk> .
until the <unk> that .
but we have this . it was starting with <unk> , no .
and then is the big question : how to be an ma , there ?
and how do you get that trust , one that trust the parents , the children , eventually brought back from a light and <unk> and other thing that trust of us that , we 're not permanently , where this to drive .
and our solution was that , we obviously a , from our parents tell us have to make , where are the <unk> , so where there is a car , where <unk> followers , maybe as well , very unfamiliar , things , homes -- that turns out you now , not the way -- because we knew , so they are .
and we had to get all bound with , us that one i think , but the other hand , listen .
and that you can now in here i 'm not all of testing , because you will it 's so loud , that they do n't , and more of them .
but <unk> , evening when you , it off the lights and wondering , in their bedrooms , or , whose bedroom , and then they orient to .
can take a try , just <unk> <unk> with the tongue , so , to orient and they 'll notice , that 's at us humans as in the bats are also -- they 're a resistance to hear .
so how the bats that with <unk> will also you hear , now <unk> wall , <unk> resistance , because the sound of different <unk> of .
and this is for me in trust , so trust , in the movement , very important .
but <unk> amount of <unk> to have and the safety , i ' <unk> chance , when i think there <unk> piece to help .
and i just to orient to no big trouble and i realized , without many accidents , the one or other , there 's course .
what i 'm going to do n't paintings anymore . i , that i very <unk> itself is , one of our <unk> , as children .
because the climb on our higher building on ♫ i 'm farm .
i , let 's written , the confidence that grows , through a <unk> diversity .
and that my darlin ' i 've been very literally , because i 'm a man , the way . much , later in <unk> and in the <unk> with confidence in the scientific side of busy . i , i 'm about one ever saying yes , or i 've never that stumbled upon how i am i was have seen .
i ' heels of it 's never leave you may also be when i read .
so , but when you are also to do with that , of course not everybody that 's just as an experience .
and diversity is the figure out of our strengths with this is announcing , to some point to know , where i 'm pretty well , what i talent and where i can you saw my strengths and it also full <unk> ?
and our brother 's again , the chance , michael and i 've always took on top of the house .
so , then , okay , we ham 's a <unk> .
because you come from somewhere i 'm a window <unk> of the <unk> for example .
and the johannes was then peel away , michael afterwards , and i , you 've probably still <unk> little bit like this girl playing , <unk> <unk> , i 'm not .
but in the end , who is like the bottom ?
so i do n't .
and i think , the others , we are , the next generation of young women , here , not .
and of so i know , and yet , with .
and then was , the consequence , that we will look at all three <unk> <unk> up sitting , and the dad , i 'm used to 'm <unk> <unk> and do n't even more you know , what he now , to say .
because of trust is one of course , then the way , when others to rule .
i had the father so , you want to god will , aid , aid , aid , if only , the danger , relative size been , that one of us , too afraid to get , and in <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> -- i 'm not -- somehow <unk> would .
is , but never happened .
he had to be wondering , then , so <unk> , he said to us that , again , <unk> has or by johannes <unk> has , of us , then returned .
and that was , i for me very great , that we these opportunities .
but now , you do n't worry , that 's not a principal , not necessary , to later <unk> .
for me were the different sports , the in my life always important were , all , yes , interesting .
and so , they were all this <unk> , because i just as i could see , where i ' i 'm so my borders , what are perhaps like my gifts .
so to <unk> good <unk> i 've never be able to .
that i had never the <unk> .
and i do 'official ' to do n't like in <unk> .
i do 'official ' to get out in the rain .
now , not at five degrees , like the moment .
and at <unk> rain , but rather than just inside .
but i ' , for me so this faith in my strengths with self , that i of sports attempted . i .
as the first for example <unk> .
and that was for me very beautiful , because there 's also the instructor , of us in <unk> had , has said , ok , we 've talked about it louder <unk> children , but they send ' us <unk> couple of the blind children .
actually about it , well , because there you pack . anyway , becomes the coats .
and then you notice , what the other .
and there was always been so my big trust , of course , when i the dreaded follow-up competition for the place to let 's a 's hard , because then you can the other perhaps , what do , what i do n't <unk> .
so there 's just a way , and this is implicit faith in my needed .
the other into a foot in the <unk> imagine , i find yourself backwards , let it fall , the <unk> head . '' and then it 's sitting in the back and the competition is over , because it 's the full score , there .
i 'll figure it 's not try it .
i did it i thought , but <unk> .
i think , this is now <unk> some miracles .
and it looks like i also now here 's not have volunteers , right ?
<unk> .
shit , i <unk> ' .
okay .
the next to me that was a sport , in the school , just then the <unk> and just <unk> .
my parents were home or are , to this <unk> and that they have , we also have taught me as children .
but to me was always in the school , it matters : how can i can and much , after the school to move , to my excess energy out ?
and there was i then a way in the school <unk> .
and although i actually always thought , that 's all so freakin ' <unk> boring , because <unk> is something for the <unk> rather , <unk> ' i .
i found , i used -- <unk> ' i today .
i then eventually , well , i do with the <unk> .
and i did , then you find them , man , again , this is the great diversity here in the sport , because you , condition , needs , you need power , downloaded a good coordination , and it <unk> extreme <unk> .
<unk> -- you may have a lot also of their work recognized ?
that 's also in <unk> .
you will only then quickly , if you just that have faith in the own humble technology .
if you that confidence in the own power has -- so the power , that you that 's also , then , every other conditions , the bad weather , the soft power of snow , the <unk> snow , the ski to bring forth .
and if you in my case you know , faith in the team .
because when <unk> , the n't see , i mean , by <unk> <unk> .
and me is still never give <unk> happens like today -- i have to the word to use -- my <unk> -- there 's `` yes , only one -- has already today , my exercise .
it , but nothing , we do you yet again .
specifically , i <unk> , you now maybe just time .
do with a , one , one of you see , which still a different exercise .
what i which is always make the subject of the blind faith , this is the practice , that i do the listener , just imagine making it 's so , if you do n't see that <unk> to try and with its <unk> <unk> .
the <unk> <unk> yes , so , you have two sticks in the hand .
of why : yeah , i ' i do n't hand anymore , you could i mean , my darlin ' <unk> take and the <unk> feel them .
n't do .
so i have to me different helping .
i then my <unk> , the now , for me .
and the told me with the voice , the route .
so the to just always the exact <unk> do .
and also that 's important for trust .
the precision , in the communications , so in the <unk> .
and the <unk> tells me just always <unk> , if it <unk> goes , the tells me <unk> and <unk> , the fortuneteller says , then , the left , 11 , i know it 's easy to left , so the upper part of technology at the pointer .
when he says , the left on a little sharper to left , and when he says , right on a decade .
okay , all understand ?
then <unk> <unk> problem , because then i have to let folks , or he had to me , i think again , i know , , now is what do n't .
and to me is yes , this very large , but before , if the <unk> , i 'm going , i have to the really completely <unk> to do it 's , negative to say .
to 's being beneficial to say , he 's for me that tool , that it enables me to , just really , and then quickly to be and in <unk> , faster than others , the in the competition to start .
and that i can only , when i am i just do , with both arms above me <unk> , i <unk> , on a leg got to stand and i must now really the eyes to make -- ha ha , or they can also open to make , to `` yes .
and to then like this <unk> and to then on the other one leg and the way back to stand and not here <unk> bit in further , but to actually can and quiet .
also to shoes .
yeah , and this is for me that very important , when i think about the <unk> 'm just imagine : how <unk> i do it , the guy to say , so i 'm a guy , because i actually just men as <unk> had , , how do it , just to say , hey , you got me with the <unk> do , because the right , the it : yeah , ourselves .
the know , not , what he tell me to .
so i 'm one , the him the way to communicate , just open to .
and that 's like in every <unk> .
if anyone in my needs n't know , he can tell me , we do n't help , but there i am just wondered , and to say : well , i got madd '' of you the curve , maybe <unk> <unk> used firm .
or i got madd '' of you like now the cycling , that you just showed me as well , says , how long , the mountain . it is , because if we the <unk> booting up , because you think , some time : now , it has yet , over .
and it 's another shot in , like nuts and that thing it 's not on .
and there 's got madd '' i then we 've also , the pilot , how it 's the cycling program called , i 'm <unk> forward , the me and says we have unfortunately only 20 minutes left behind us , because we may -- so we ham the other times <unk> minutes to -- then we are you know , but again , rather <unk> .
of why is that for me , really important , there , the population of stomach , weirdly fine-tuned <unk> .
i listen , ' <unk> -- here 's probably another , the also <unk> <unk> driving ?
who is more ?
so my best for there was already times faster , but that was in september , and so in april , may i figured it honest , still never been so much faster on how thirty-six minute .
and at the uncanny the moment very <unk> .
and for me , again , it 's that we got <unk> only then it possible , when i just mean your ears , i did .
the other just showed me , exactly explain , what he comes to try to see , and i 'm so the possibility that there , my risk in perfect , estimate .

so , ' paste them as a blind , not so much , frankly , i said -- from <unk> .
because i also have the experience had to me a <unk> right , and left his firm .
and then was that in the competition and at the bad , because it 's the way across three meters <unk> .
and i 'm the three feet just <unk> .
of so -- again , this was -- of course <unk> on .
that i know , because the <unk> to be wondering , yes , around , have so <unk> <unk> .
and i think about it happening today still permanently , that i got people say , the left and say , then , <unk> , the other left .
so i was then , right , unfortunately .
does the ground , often not so much .
but , in <unk> situation with pressure , that you probably also all of the work or the university , as you look , if it 's , quickly go to .
then is , precision , yes <unk> <unk> hard challenge .
but to me , again , it 's the blind faith that , that i the risks that you know .
and because i must be honest , say , i am more than anyone , the n't see , relative size of the advantage , because i <unk> ' i took risks in many ways .
so the <unk> <unk> ' i now that 's pretty all .
the driving <unk> tree , from the slope , down <unk> , the know , and i and i <unk> , but of course , and this is yes , that important -- i <unk> ' , the good news sites .
the which then also be achieved , if that trust this is there .
and if you know somebody has found , the men 's really , a hundred percent of so <unk> , i am i just need .
and with the i do so , also the same carbon targets . i .
because this is for me in the subject to trust me just the next , very important .
you need the goal and i have to leave you really , it will , which is about it really , trust , go ?
because of is often <unk> faster the term , you time .
i trust , or the or my own devices .
but this very important is yes , that it , too much depend on .
that you for that you for trust a lot <unk> .
and that you yes , -- because we are all with <unk> <unk> college , and do -- we want <unk> that sense .
and the sense , the is very often , that we just might also create , 'n goal together to achieve .
that we do it -- in my case for example -- from some , weeks . i ' i am i on the <unk> gone .
and there <unk> ' i just , i have to me now , who seek , or the i said in the case that can count , that i just this mountain , up up .
and how do you , then , you to look at the mountain , some really up there 's right ?
well , i 'd shifted course , on the advantage , i , some things right now we did n't see , if it for example , beside me a hundred meters <unk> .
then i was this is less .
ca <unk> be an advantage , is heights , which is no problem .
and i , as well , at the wooded heights that worked , regardless of the <unk> i 'm too . '' and to time , i ' i then did something <unk> <unk> or i 'm in berlin <unk> flew , because you 're going to <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
this is already <unk> bit <unk> , then up there is , and down the car stop , then you still not a lot to see , to be there to know , now , do it hurts , when i <unk> .
and these things are , i always been quite interesting .
now , you to also the <unk> to have , but to just as to know , hey , i war , of , when i think there 's so yes , focus , <unk> and can just by but also got a new new experience .
and that <unk> <unk> bit of the <unk> , because at <unk> mountain <unk> yes , so , you go every day , 10 hours ago , and it 's some of just still get
you go and go and has only still rocks to try to do , less plants .
you take the <unk> <unk> with , <unk> gun -- of years ago i 'm half the first world war with camera traps .
so if you <unk> <unk> see , is the <unk> about the last , the <unk> .
of something else , and so that they are exciting .
we have the <unk> just from the distance ever seen or the other one you .
of so <unk> ' i there <unk> a faith in the <unk> -- despite his silly <unk> , that he and i had .
because i thought i got madd '' : well , so , as i said , <unk> ' i probably get away , how to the that thing you load .
but again , it 's otherwise very <unk> , because you know , to <unk> actually now not that 's a lot of change .
and really exciting about it 's and then , yes , something hard .
so if you then in the air , and the air to be thinner .
or if it 's next one off , then <unk> little <unk> has , where 's left and right off .
then it 's particularly beautiful and if it 's actually , still night is , and all with <unk> <unk> , has at us the <unk> , sometimes as well , now he would i 'd come to the rope off taking out , so he then i really , in the view , and in the grip .
because i as the only without <unk> there <unk> and that was him , but sometimes to be risky .
trust , we have this is , that i just said . i : well , i can course of mine who , my friend , the problems that was , a hundred percent of trust , i <unk> , you and we have that before , well <unk> .
but i got madd '' also <unk> form of security , so i 'm not permanently in the focus to , because , you can imagine , if you on the mountain just always say <unk> stone , right to focus on one , the left , 11 .
there will you some <unk> , and everybody is .
so for us is implicit faith in the case was , we 're <unk> connection , so ham , we have a rope off at your backpack , it that i had in the hand , and i 'm then behind her in which loosely <unk> rope has gone .
i had in the other <unk> <unk> , that i also with <unk> bit of the height of stairs , which i did .
and you is then eventually the only still , with the foot <unk> stone had or has to <unk> <unk> stone , knocked on , that i just as well , already know , so on me ask , and i 'm not permanently , just focus had .
and what i looked at the men 's really has shown , how beautiful it 's actually , you kind of course , and then eventually , because the peak getting near , that you just that goal really so again in the corner , has -- just like , the <unk> , with the <unk> .
other hand , but it 's also true that i realized i did , that trust , that i in me . i , that is , let them , but only there , now if i really <unk> goal . i , like this is the top .
but that trust is also in other , the <unk> , like trust and just work .
when we then at night of the <unk> are , we were in the group , very ahead and behind us are the other seven people walked and that were always be quite mishandled one behind us and it has to every moment was somebody else behind us and i 've been thinking : tell ' time , why do that because why this because , everybody , that he 's behind us can run ?
at night , you can also the girls not from behind you look .
this is somehow not the apparently .
and then got madd '' i mean time , oh yeah , ok , their faith in their skills that 's been also some pretty <unk> .
you go there at night by the darkness , you go to 12 watch off , has then why do n't no light .
this is , defy , if you <unk> is , the air is being thin , so really only still going to defy gravity and now . <unk> first place .
and then it 's but eventually , so the moment , where the know , i have said : yeah , man , that was actually really practical , behind you to go , because the friend of me has just showed me all explained , we 've always <unk> -- like that women , doing .
have all the night of us anything about and the other in the group had the right there 's also like the recognition , <unk> to know , ok , it is now only <unk> hour , that she have to me then told .
or i quit her what 's very different now , not the mountain was telling .
and that to know , it 's still up there , it may also just lousy about <unk> that we have some time talking about -- it are only still <unk> hour , the sun 's going on .
what these things , this also used mirrors from the outside can trust , significantly increase and can just that , you to look like the personal medal of ideas , yet .
and to me is trust , then given , and it 's all , then the perfect , if you just like the personal medal and that , what 's really do n't want , then eventually , in the idea of the right there is .
this is course , in the exercise with the gold , in that you so <unk> -- i actually also not , why that 's making -- maybe , i 'm not , to the value to test , or to look , whether it 's and yet it lead , very is ?
so i think , at some medals that it 's so , in vancouver in the were six grams a hard .
if that everything from the gold would , <unk> i 'm not here , i would have the <unk> , think i .
now , or in <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
but again , i think , the real , why you do that , is more , that you can imagine : what i ' i really have been created and how i mean , skills and very focused on a point .
how i ' i in me in my skills , but of course , in the team , that we all need , no matter whether in school , in the job in which one thing .
anyway , whether an old man or young woman , we need some of people , in the we ca n't trust .
and if we then that goal in the head clear , have eyes and that 's also have reached out , this is that the best of evidence , that we 're looking at least in a project in our lives of trust , i did .
and if you , once you can , you can 's also , and it in other areas .
thank you
a science for me , this is the title of my talk , the that is to <unk> your nice maps .
which i was driving , is the very <unk> effort , the sciences , again as something <unk> in the general population to attach .
in this issue , i could be satisfied .
if i in a barnes <unk> , there 's all <unk> only with the literature to science data subjects , the <unk> <unk> is .
even though every <unk> has a range of <unk> <unk> newspapers , magazines , <unk> , where the major issues , collections of topics , somehow get across the way .
every station has at least a <unk> , where some major issues into ever undertaken .
even , that 's totally <unk> , if you look like , what it in magazines and <unk> for children there with scientific issues .
every program has somehow , a own off in <unk> , is that a pure <unk> story .
science is one thing , that can i 'd like to see , that can i 'd like reading , but that that 's me , not themselves .
cool , cool is science just kind , at csi , in breaking bad , somewhere , there are the chemist cool , <unk> ?
in csi to look like a <unk> five minutes , has actually ca n't do with the reality to do , but that 's cool , <unk> ?
there , you can i can identify .
big bang theory , because i can get a laugh , i understand the jokes , not , but it 's fine .
this is extremely too .
because , that 's kind of a paradox , the future we 'll just going to be able to the technological issues and issues .
but at bay area that 's not going to to itself .
i 've got a few little brief examples , these things , like science , or science at us that in a given .
a very <unk> example , in london , you have a tower being built , <unk> , the architect , , not so now , we build the time somehow being so <unk> .
what happens is , right now , the sunlight from up in this facade , i think that time <unk> well , which is focused , and somewhere in other that you on a point centre .
this was the size by the press , stood there , just a jaguar .
too , the heat which has to that channeled , that this poor <unk> , the really long , long to go has , there are the <unk> time .
there she asks you , like an architect , has the n't actually sort of times as a bit of what in physics have learned , because i mean , is yes , completely new , that such a mirror of targets .
so , what i found , very new , is <unk> , somehow from in , where he could walk with you are a fleet of an innocent mind .
there is and i really , what 's the more design or an architect , or where he has studied uk ?
now this is a very <unk> example .
a classic , which is given such current to have , is also the <unk> .
<unk> , now that 's been a few years ago , that looked at some way in the media got .
there was the train has sailed , because <unk> changed the plants , that was at a danger .
genes that was n't equate to green <unk> .
genes that were kind of what we first .
<unk> , oh , there are gene inside .
there 's all situations where , in the market on , that really become like , hey , i <unk> vegetables .
no idea what that we want to , yeah .
so , yes , okay , dutch tomatoes , we can get a debate .
but to the time i was in the lab . it 's an engagement and was eventually , frustrated , because i 've tried , these evil genes in my bacterial <unk> , these <unk> <unk> .
and was totally frustrated , came home to , and my day my neighbor , oh , you see , but it 's happy , which is because this ?
i like this : yeah , i 'm trying been there are three days like a little gene in my bacterial cells to transform and this works at all .
this was , what i 've tried , to to explain , so somehow an <unk> , genetics , i thought , you can see the good old lady , when i of genes , speaking , you know them , what they now .
this was , what i actually meant , so one particular sequence , that i there in this <unk> <unk> i wanted to .
but it was the , what the woman has seen .
this woman has i 'm never again , the hand , all shook up !
who knows , what i do you <unk> , <unk> ?
genes is what 's very bad outcome .
now that 's been good about 10 years ago , and yet it has the way in awareness ones .
genes , this is at what we first .
<unk> i 'm right time . read .
it 's then , gene and technology , and it has but really in our language to draw weight on .
<unk> to europe , was a headline .
<unk> different . it a lot of other american corn , the yes , it does not genes that contains .
in terms of headline writers , <unk> makes a rat , to die .
yes , that was also a headline .
that are , but not so old and it 's also is no matter , on what level , i be ways .
anyway , whether the time , or the picture , all talk from <unk> .
fortunately , it 's still not <unk> in <unk> arrived , but i 'm afraid , and that takes , not more time .
but that simply shows , which of insecurity in the population is now , because they just not going to the themes of interest .
nevertheless , we have in our future us with these technologies are .
now was just <unk> , nobody had the size of the subject , but it be about things are outliers , and one , what the most really no idea .
and that 's pretty sad .
how is actually , that recommendation out of the lab in the population ?
if we assume , this small , boy , , scientists are sitting in his lab , has a little experiment , set examples like , beautiful and well , and he does think about is , man , this is , what , that interested , but the public .
then to the first , at the professor .
the head , the decide , then , okay , very cool topic , of his name on a <unk> , that 's always important in the science , <unk> be .
good idea , i 'm still not in the public , it goes on a <unk> .
yes , the <unk> think , oh great idea , class , because we make a press <unk> .
<unk> , because we have a press left with a project , a fabulous idea , and that 's coming then some way out of ivory .
this is then <unk> , but at who really ?
now are like the institute 's rarely go alone , usually have multiple <unk> like a common all , a shared <unk> .
and of all these are then the <unk> , the really cool projects , then , are over the <unk> at the magazine , at the editors , no matter whether it leibniz , <unk> , <unk> or <unk> .
this is the way .
from the it will always on about , in ivory up into the really , really cool experiments , then , that actually speak of projects , there in these <unk> come up .
that are out on a magazine , that are actually done well , there 's from all there 's free , but who up , i do ?
in this just the , the , for interest .
in the <unk> we call this , the <unk> the <unk> .
so that , the way . already doing that interested , the <unk> then still the newspaper , beautiful and good .
as a magazine , the audience , the , the way . to be interested , and that maybe about a have , where <unk> 's even in these articles .
who <unk> ' i so , but really ?
the <unk> , that it might be interested .
the way , that was now , the otto was an ordinary citizen , i call it 's , mr. <unk> <unk> , of the circumstances of the publications i read , i tried , it 's not to balance , the up , i do n't really .
yet , again , our future , we will only way up , if we faced with these <unk> engage .
fracking , <unk> , renewables , <unk> , that are all stories , the <unk> are , the gentleman <unk> but not really understand , and over the he sort of voting by all .
my project , my idea is therefore , we need , this little , young , you get a scientist working out of ivory coast to take , really completely from its regular <unk> to separate , and he 's a course , to do , a seminar , how science , which communicates .
because what usually happens , that a scientist , so i have a buddy , we know where we 've been good about twenty years , he 's <unk> , it 's at us a go unwritten rule , it 's not after his job to wonder .
when he the mouth to go and over his career telling , and it has us <unk> .
<unk> , that are scientists , the tell you then , what of <unk> .

reactivity , treated , that 's kind , oh , you do n't know , which is that .
the really teach , some time , that 's beautiful and well , if you on a conference , and your people , your <unk> , on <unk> anything to tell you want , you can you 'd like of <unk> tell , blinding glimpse of the time , say , just water .
where is the problem , it really <unk> and normal to talk ?
i school , that 's my idea , these young scientist , the still not so far in the hierarchy <unk> are , the still a little more malleable , are , the school i , you an argument .
that has for all of a use , <unk> , as well , unsophisticated investors , the globe , also know , what 's in the <unk> happens .
finally , are also , tax , the there are used , so that have to actually also the <unk> communicate .
but the these training , this is just a story .
i want them , really a jury her sit and the to your project , imagine , the project a jury , very tough , relentlessly , and there 's not , children .
there 's a quote , i do n't know , if this is real , of albert einstein , if you do it 's not just tell you can , and then you it does n't really understood .
so , the scientists from the lab to take and your project really need to rethink , how to really quite normal is intelligible to communicate ?
so that 's been a range .
<unk> are totally modern , is everywhere , at each of the university , of course , but there also up , i in this just the <unk> .
who , because for <unk> end of town in the university at some morning , then , there a talk to <unk> times . '' ?
these are the , that it might be interested .
because i went back to my <unk> .
so , are the people , the way . might be able to be interested , that there , and wondering , there is to speak to listen .
that 's beautiful , there are any <unk> done , all these are satisfied , all these are happy , to go home and this is it .
so you down , i still on a second point , to say , it is not at this <unk> the project .
those scientists are also still probably trained , wired , actually children ?
because many really , or hard-hearted to have , on the essential to reduce .
because scientists , like the research , and how children , their world , exploring , is the same .
children are working very very scientific definition .
they do anything like to learn from the running .
they try to , it work ?
<unk> , falling down , no way , does n't work , next to repetition , i change a couple of parameters , i do it still , new .
children learn from extremely scientifically .
that are really <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , i <unk> , what happens , which of factors i needed to change , that it works or not .
this is normal .
but that have many , or hard-hearted to .
and of therefore i think , really can work that only , soon after the <unk> it and those scientists had permanently in the neighborhood , in the environment with the kids out of kindergarten , from the school , there 's all these are the children , on their <unk> , and wondering , there really do it with , because i believe , the children and the scientists are actually in this same language .
and then you can perhaps , maybe some point , that 's my hope , tell the kids that , back home , and then up , i also , mr. <unk> , the , then , at for a major issues are interested , because the children beside him that tell you .
this is then not anywhere in the newspaper , that 's not anywhere , galileo , but his children to tell him , something , that it <unk> mirror , with a <unk> on china has that , but a bread <unk> has that , and paper is lit that has , and understand , and shaking , then perhaps , head , as an architect , like a house can build .
and not just up , i then , mr. <unk> , but the <unk> .
this is my idea , my vision , my project .
unfortunately <unk> it just about it , that the first <unk> , that i 'd have , have said , yes , the way , so , <unk> for our scientists , that this is just not subject , the 've just other priorities .
a scientist to yes , not able to communicate .
yes , i think i then , okay , and i the next .
but who somehow , at work , <unk> is in a company , as well , there 's in the next moment .
thank you .
i 'm crazy , is the question .
and fly you can also not every day .
the past weeks were terrible .
the weather around us has a big is through the bill did .
now , for seven , soon after eight years , i 've been asked , if i 'm here that they want .
i was before the ceo , almost 10 years , the <unk> <unk> in munich , and in <unk> .
we 're there are quite far , coming .
they had <unk> as a client .
and for me was that actually more , well , this is <unk> .
what is this really ?
<unk> , that 's really completely ridiculous .
i then , but i 've learned about who is that is , and that i stand here today .
and yes , maybe it 's a little crazy , but it is , as high , emotionally .
it 's beautiful and always exciting and makes great fun .
and i 'm going to you just in the next <unk> , eighteen minutes a little bit of this life expectancy of <unk> tell you .
i 'm from ceos in <unk> .
the company , there 's been a hundred and <unk> years .
i 'm the ceo of <unk> .
this company , there 's been 20 years .
and ceo of <unk> .
the company , there 's been about <unk> or hit eighteen years .
that runs the zeppelin here at the <unk> .
zeppelin .
that a picture , that i do you here want to show , the little one point , right , that 's really that a red , like a <unk> on , or anything , do n't know , yes , that particular point is still need to big .
there 's because the world 's just <unk> <unk> .
and of these are actually just now is still 10 to action .
this is already what .
there 's about 20 thousand standing around world <unk> .
so that 's actually not like a market .
that 's also not a niche interest .
this is a <unk> , a <unk> .
and the question is also , why do you that then it ?
how is this really ?
<unk> in which was and only 10 to action , because we can see , which still , even talk about why this is .
so very quickly the history .
<unk> has a of you crazy <unk> <unk> the back here 's started .
very short quick .
has to <unk> fourteen years ago , the first world war in eighteen <unk> into in '' .
then they were in the first world war . <unk> zeppelin and died , <unk> and <unk> , have been around <unk> <unk> built for <unk> .
the have then in london , of the federal and so , and so on .
and when we <unk> and eight to london got these are , and with a big <unk> there a <unk> campaign to fly , they do the newspapers <unk> with the headline said , this time they come up , but not to bombs , but in a peaceful in itself .
so that has the story in there <unk> .
and we had an insane campaign .
but <unk> , the client , was not so very pleased , because he suddenly realized that 's gone , what 's still is really stuck , which old memory in there 'd put them .
and you know that was , for the marketing -- a critical .
but it was in london a good dress campaign for the weather in north end up there was many years ago , very bad and very <unk> .
and we 're not very much for flying .
then has <unk> two decades , <unk> <unk> hugo <unk> this has taken .
and has a <unk> for maybe , that then to america and delivered by the world .
that has a myth , where , that all the german nation of course , again something felt that has , which <unk> and <unk> that airship has been .
there was the then in new york , receiving letters to pin .
and the german nation 's up , has <unk> , we are again , who .
this is in all the lives , so inside and actually this is that tells a little bit of myth of this device .
but actually are then to <unk> and <unk> just five , six , seven <unk> even odder still were built and really only two really big , the <unk> zeppelin and the hindenburg , the passengers if you have .
passengers , a hundred , where there <unk> passengers , and <unk> it was the end <unk> <unk> .
it was , but a myth .
and the <unk> then this was at the first broadcast live filmed crash , there , unfortunately , <unk> .
the titanic that event at , where a one icon , a a product <unk> is , and then also never more and then in flight .
also the other fm devices have been in .
and <unk> , <unk> the last day of the existing <unk> destroyed .
that the materials used for <unk> , <unk> , the halls come into some .
and then i was for nothing about their sixties years .
and then the had the <unk> zf <unk> and the zeppelin , that had the idea , maybe you want to the back to start .
and i was hired <unk> , because it 's technically a great product has evolved , we come in this , but the market .
yes , he 's actually a market ?
what 's actually go ?
so .
talk about that we now .
the <unk> zeppelin , that may still just to explain , we ham , in time it 's still , <unk> , who has a lot done .
there 's many companies , the out of this corporation that are .
it are today <unk> , about 20 billion of revenue .
this is a real entails , the profitable .
there 's a lot behind .
the 've got me , confident , here back to come .
the zeppelin to be wondering , is really a very normal power plane as any other small plane , but she has , sorry , has very spongy inside a gas , the helium 's not evolve hydrogen , and very , a <unk> with <unk> .
it 's like a whale , the in the water on and the bottom up , and there the <unk> to alert .
the time now is not there , that in the details to understand .
it looks a zeppelin and so , with a structure .
there 's two varieties of <unk> .
there 's rigid <unk> , this is us . <unk> in the case , and <unk> .
the have within , no structure and that are sort of how balloons , <unk> .
these are the most <unk> , in the world was built these are , about four , a kilometer .
and it 's only today , as i said , only still <unk> in was a brisk -10 with our own was , so there 's only still two decades .
this is then the production of , if a shell where one of .
the left the structure . it again .
and the shell is also <unk> .
it comes from the <unk> .
source : the <unk> the astronauts .
<unk> then there are the origins .
it 's one point two million dollars , like a shell .
and is to <unk> be , to <unk> be and also has to <unk> be , because , you have to yes , at mit , that if , a crack in it would or a hole , that 's not going to suck .
there are the <unk> again <unk> do and look right , whether it 's going on the black holes in control .
and the end looks a flying airship on without the international community of like it 's there .
the zeppelin -- is so technically a <unk> product .
and that you look down here at the numbers , very short time .
one point where nine percent , one point where nine percent , one point , six times four percent <unk> , that means of a thousand flights , about falling , maybe <unk> .
this is very little bit and very good .
this is a <unk> .
that can do to see .
but there 's a different trend , of us now about power and the have i ended up here 's mapped .
we had three years ago forty-three percent <unk> , when i started ago , <unk> five , eight years ago , <unk> percent <unk> and last year <unk> percent <unk> or <unk> .
and this year in may , we were in their sixties percent .
if you the eight years , eight years , at the zeppelin <unk> and <unk> it to get to , then you can say at least in these eight years , a the blink of the <unk> , as well , in these eight years has the weather , clearly changed for us .
we 're <unk> .
we can because the passengers , not by a fog .
the globe , yes , that you see .
and the <unk> or <unk> 're actually every year , has been .
so a picture of the fact , that our weather , not just felt , but also , statistically , because we do the weather , every day , changes .
but because that 's so , this is now that well , has the e.u. , a program being remade <unk> to do , almost 10 million dollars , and we 're an essential part of this program .
i come morning is just from finland .
this airship on here is equipped , is a flying lab .
<unk> called the campaign .
and we do <unk> in the <unk> between earth and <unk> feet .
that means <unk> <unk> .
and the zeppelin in time flies of italy , to get up to finland in a <unk> <unk> .
over many many hundreds <unk> measure the and analyzed the air out how the way . reactivity , as you will respond in our stuff , that we the bottom , do .
there , so i just explain , up there are we 're dealing with the second airship on .
a great a great assignment .
and is that if you want to have extracted from the subject of weather .
that 's so very well .
and here are still alive once a few <unk> .
this airship on top of sweden , the last week or <unk> week .
and in finland is the way the weather 's good , <unk> , <unk> degrees , 30 degrees .
the <unk> say that they were still never .
i i 've got there are wonderful , as a warm and we 've regressed .
that they were actually , not so bad .
we were also in africa .
and have to aubrey de <unk> as <unk> diamond , for , better said , is volcanoes go for , the underground worlds are , the away are , erosion , by a million years .
it can you also ask , is , that 's all over africa , is that then a more sense if you to make sense of questions , after an idea of questions , to make sense of thing is it makes sense when the same time in theater at the film <unk> or the blood diamond 's gone .
because i time ever wondered , you know what we do it 's really ?
and what are we are there is really ?
the end , we were after two years , done .
the ode to actually , not on .
the <unk> came back <unk> and this project was then finish .
and a tornado that has the zeppelin was in the mast , then at that damaged , that he also going down to do .
i was , but not so bad .
we had it 's very good insurance , and they were quite a very happy .
this was looking at the prototype .
and i did n't know what i 'm going to do with .
yes , what we do , a very brief <unk> from the from the studied there .
what we do , it goes up with just to , it goes to embrace complexity , it goes to ask , growth or was .
what we do is the <unk> here in <unk> .
we do to service of course .
we we have the zeppelin was always get .
<unk> called an aging .
there are yes , also be inside , after 10 , i would have been lucky again , the be replaced .
we replace taxation on the entire <unk> for nearly five million dollars .
there with the clients <unk> talk about that we still .
we do we have the <unk> constantly doing .
we 're a little <unk> of business , the of the germans <unk> and of the european and we do that controls it , having to and the time , with more like <unk> , or as an airbus .
that 's also <unk> and costs money and must always on also get stressed .
the question is : do you actually on ?
you want to develop ?
you make greater <unk> ?
there 's <unk> , unmanned <unk> .
what you do it 's really ?
you go further in the market ?
you go further in the business ?
and the course we have in my time , attempted .
and because we 've also some <unk> suffered .
how the way , the <unk> zeppelin -- some <unk> has sustained and this bust .
the beginning in the billboard stood still the donation of <unk> .
the population of the german age population has it was saved with six million <unk> as a donation , as the fourth airship crashes . ♫ and he basically , broke it was , has the population of him a donation .
and it 's all the <unk> <unk> zeppelin and the other companies that , otherwise we were or <unk> i today anyway , not here and also other companies would n't there .
we were in tokyo , <unk> .
we were , and you hear the past , in san francisco to a customer .

two projects are actually failed .
so , <unk> .
the same time we have <unk> won .
because i got no image that , because we that <unk> emblem still not show .
but just in america is now the <unk> of the first <unk> in the finished .
we have three and sells .
with <unk> are we like a with a partner , the technology , a new .
and this is a great success , but at the defeat of ideas .
two clients are basically , liquidate been , because it was .
why it was not ?
we know it actually already .
either was the location , not the right or the passengers had to go <unk> or in america 's not know you <unk> the last 30 forty years , the commercials have done .
the ham the people have <unk> , have the airship that , have said : oh , again a , again a <unk> , the power of ads .
there can that we did n't , that , <unk> .
and it was actually have difficult in marketing is all over to : hey , people call to be , and fly .
<unk> 's good .
the pilots to the year , transport , embrace <unk> , <unk> passengers .
but last year we 've just <unk> done because of weather .
there are then the same thing once a half million .
this is then bad .
the zeppelin and going <unk> are here .
it 's the point , the course is beautiful , when i also when ceos , then i see how the passengers get out and , and all laughing and we basically , also do n't do advertising , because it 's mouth to speak about and , we got about <unk> sold their voucher could have and the people say , this is so beautiful , and i recommend it your friends , which and who also always on , in the family .
and we 're great 's .
which way , i clean to begin with the mistake , that you think we 're booked ahead .
you could still more flights .
we have so a <unk> the <unk> and we let 's booked ahead .
so that is actually also not quite .
we do , advertising .
this is , a project was , that an audi sponsored by .
and an audi claimed that made here with the island <unk> together .
but the <unk> is a difficult to market .
and you must be wondering , sometimes , the <unk> imagine : do commercials , makes sense ?
we have yes , enough ads , but the internet has much change , the <unk> about the launch , because the <unk> all of control .
the <unk> is largely <unk> , it 's why you today is still 10 active <unk> in the world .
we have three here .
two active , one came , that <unk> , three has <unk> bought , 10 percent are actively .
so are then six of 10 .
that means we 're then the fact , if it does one is , control .
and hope , it also again a future , something that to discover .
and what the end with david , scott , commander of the apollo have thought , after his <unk> paris <unk> and five , he has said , just at the walk on the <unk> what <unk> .
so <unk> .
do advertising , we also .
only we find any customers .
<unk> to do we find great , has a technological value .
because we have any customers .
this is not at .
it 's <unk> , goes on and .
so a bit like a bid takes years until you , but what you .
and then there 's then again , no .
there 's also very kind of the effect , the easy for and hard to control .
, is that the situation , <unk> , a point in the market , so actually not the market .
yet we do it on .
it 's an icon of the region .
the <unk> have the power to do it .
they ask yourself to just about the question : in what form we make it on ?
how much money give you 're in the market ?
what do what do for here ?
in what form is that are ?
and i personally , they 've got me also asked , a personal to say , i 'm sort of course , my history <unk> , where i <unk> <unk> wanted , back against the big , drag , <unk> has this little <unk> dead , you want , it 's also here to rescue .
i was also again , greenpeace , three years <unk> , when i went through the vancouver island of people and i am and this whole <unk> forest that have , has made me that <unk> , that when i think there . i do .
and then there 's a <unk> about greenpeace , the money , choked up there are and do n't know what they do to be and almost took it to actually gone .
there you have to employ , to the very keen to <unk> .
and i for three years from greenpeace was as <unk> and now i think this is in the hope , a long the future in the zeppelin to achieve .
zero , that right ? forty seconds , i 'm still done , thanks .
<unk>
yes , thank you .
that are my three penalty points , that i in the eighteen minutes to go to .
why we are today , from mountains , or in abundant economy ?
how we come to that deprives us ?
and so , , what do ?
what 's what it 's really ?
we start with our first point .
the first part is perhaps a pretty depressing .
but it 's also , right , the challenges to show .
a few years about , that even harder was , this sort to understand .
that we have a problem have today , you know that every child .
that we environmental problems .
but it 's worthwhile to have , every time to suggest , are the challenges that growth for example .
all kinds <unk> are rising exponential increase .
if you put it in a historical , long view is , the oil for example , what is a very short , episode in the story has been to be .
now , we can not imagine that , it differently about , that oil , keep up .
you know the climate change , the last <unk> years .
some people say , well , once there 's time the columbian , we look at the last <unk> years .
that you can also <unk> at , <unk> ' i also , right .
you can also say , who needs because the glacier ?
you can also say , the ocean is far away .
but it goes , then , if you a little bit more with the sort of the real challenge of the things , that 's really to avoid it is , otherwise we 've just in the <unk> , the health .
<unk> it 's a few days over 30 degrees .
and there 's degree '' in our cities like in vienna , or <unk> sort always more and further , bad .
it goes , but also to the <unk> , especially in asia .
if you see at the himalayas , where the big streams that is how and the <unk> of notes on that there with water from the himalayas .
it 's the end , not to the planet .
the planet is that <unk> , what we do , because there 's been much larger environmental crisis .
and <unk> , but it goes to us to the people , the sort , in a radically altered our ecosystems , very uncomfortable to live forever .
it goes to the loss of biodiversity .
the deserts , ice .
the water will still less .
this is the aral sea , where an essential part of cotton , from .
and all this , where that come from ?
all these bad things , let’s ' , depend in the one or another form with the global <unk> together .
of what we 've made out of the ground up , what we harvest .
not just , the oil and the metals together and the minerals , but the power of resources are going to renewable , but the end , that close .
and we should just look , that we so little as possible of waste , to also the end , less than waste and the emissions to produce .
so it 's why , this is in the introduction , said already been the <unk> really dramatically raised to reduce .
this is the challenge , not only climate , not just a c , oh , two , <unk> of a car on a different , but really differently .
another way to rebuilding economies .
our technology essentially entirely new to change .
if we still , just look back the hunters and collector , and there 's still on the earth societies , the in principle that life , come with a ton of resources in the year per person and year .
in a <unk> it was then in the longest time the human history , three to five million tons .
today are it would have to <unk> .
so <unk> has to this <unk> .
and he 's very , unequally distributed around the earth .
it 's in north america would be more than at us at us more than for the earth is unsustainable .
and in other parts of the world , you look in africa , very , much less .
and there 's , we 's the impact at us , the rivers , the air is much better to become in the last decades , but it is basically , it , that we in other parts of the shift .
and the other parts of the let the but still less like it .
and why are also the conflict , that we see , of <unk> , is , afghanistan , enable you look at them on the maps of american geological survey , and then you see , where the resources from .
and this is it 's there 's very colorful , which means , there 's many materials there , where the <unk> the world .
so if we do with clean want , then we have to the subject of interest .
so we have to change , the ecological limits are everywhere , the <unk> 's everywhere .
and that , what we here at <unk> lives have it 's not <unk> .
that has been of mahatma gandhi , were philosophizing when he has said , the world has enough for everybody needs , but not for everybody greed .
and there we are , like this room . the average life , it a lot of it .
so .
this was the sort <unk> part .
but i always , that you the needs to understand it 's worth , as well , what to change .
however , i see , which would say , it 's worth , also like so , not like to live , which is more deprives us .
but it 's yet , sort , from the <unk> <unk> you need , but a rationale , say , i time .
so , which is actually that deprives us ?
and because we have to find that we in our to share the world is so much have reached the economically , socially valued at the quality , at the standard , us in the average , often do n't feel .
here 's a pretty good or mood , but there 's people , and you sure , people , that 's not that good can deal with this story .
i time i wrote that there .
<unk> and climate have the same cause .
we 're going to a lot and to do .
this is the one side and we get yourself in the stress , and eventually it 's too much .
i 'm also very happy to .
and the other side , which we that <unk> .
what is then a good life ?
how we can that defines what ?
now here 's a a little piece of break .
this is also , what i 'd say we have and what i later tell me is scientific , valid , but here is it 's just figure , how to sort of times what ?
and there 's important , to understand better life has always two aspects .
life has the aspect of the objective conditions as it me goes , what i 'm going to eat .
i was a roof over the head ?
i was friends ?
i relationship , i can the life to participate ?
but just as well , let 's me with , how do 'official ' i was have to to ?
i <unk> ' that sometimes the perceived to quality .
and then <unk> ' i two words pop into , the , i 'm going to work .
this one 's needs .
the needs are the very fundamental way our human development , our there 's drum , to feelings .
if we need -- we can , we 're happy .
and what you ca n't say , needs are unsustainable , or not sustainable .
needs by se have reduced still not to <unk> .
what are the needs ?
you can be different place in a quote , i here 's only two .
and there you of the physical needs , but also need for safety , social relations .
to protect us , to participation , after <unk> , creativity , spirituality , for freedom .
all this has a little do with money to do .
but to a part of not actually , but the question is , how can i think that in my life set .
and there i am at the second important term .
the strategy .
the strategy , that i 'm using the me to is available to me that needs to meet .
and there 's then , you know , that i can sort with a high <unk> or with a low <unk> do .
because i can not much money to or a little money you need .
strategies that are just my devils behave like i was my needs <unk> .
that has to my values to do , with the resources , with the possibilities , that i .
if i little money i 'm going ' i did my needs to try , to meet as if i sort of money on the bank account .
it 's first to the <unk> , this is the roof over the head , to eat , and then sort of them to the <unk> .
and here 's then you know , that can with a lot sooner or a little <unk> , that can sort that , or <unk> be .
and if we all the strategies , the me to stand to my needs to meet , summarize , then we talk about one of lifestyle .
so .
this was the kind of scientific break .
and now let 's drum to do now ?
how it 's how does it ?
and there 's just a couple of clues .
now , we have to this sort , everybody for yourself to themselves will find .
but these are the the individual way on a technological way , here is , think , i , a lot also about engineering 've been , and finally , on a political way .
what we can do ?
what we can do ?
what we do ?
so , where we want to go ?
the slides , the verge have sort , the danger is , we sort , always more affluence , more resources to use .
the end , the quality of back down , because that , the effects , and there are , sort , and on us in the end user back to beat .
or , whether we do it , there in a different direction . go , the with less <unk> , perhaps , less than consumption , but with a higher quality that are connected .
there 's one of my <unk> , maybe you know him some , <unk> of <unk> of this topic <unk> , so more lives with less <unk> .
there 's a lot to technology like i can see every single thing , that here we use the computer , the orange juice , the coffee in the car , the traffic , how can i felt that make ?
and cement , i can today , not make , i can that 's home from wood to build , etc. .
to collaborate with a much less <unk> more or the same quality to create .
my other teachers , <unk> <unk> has this is expressed wishes , the <unk> per <unk> , and there are we go in the , which is also have time i discussed was is , there 's very deep sense that on it to look .
where are actually the needs ?
what services , i can really satisfy us ?
and how to do with the amount of <unk> do ?
and it 's not with a little bit less , but with <unk> , <unk> , nine-tenths percent less .
there 's many examples of the this sort already .
in vienna , to a seven-story building be built with two are allowed .
with seven percent allowed it 's in <unk> already built .
that basically , from wood has .
that you , maybe it in fifty years . need to dissect it and then again in its parts and not sort , so , very much less resources , of dealing with everything else , you go from there are , the moment with the half and the goal is with a fifth of <unk> , over the whole lifetime of the house that , with this kind of <unk> long .
it goes , but also a lot in our own , sort , <unk> ' i really ?

where he shows , how hard it in the end is sort of really from the from the sort of the treadmill out .
the <unk> , i want to me , so to go over the others come after , and then i 'm sort forever , in this in this race .
you which has sort 's zone , that i was very satisfied , and then they do 'official ' i was the new .
the most <unk> ' i the <unk> , that you know of all .
when i do for themselves at a year . i few years ago we have still have letter writing .
then you have sort of waiting to be able to the letter back now to write , i downloaded a email , is a massive <unk> .
to write , i had hundreds of email .
and i should be very much longer afford .
this is productivity , this is economic growth , we get that in a back .
but i did n't really time to go .
i 've got to me with a failure is done .
but there 's good examples , slow food for instance where i really sort of the claim the quality and the one of <unk> in the foreground , in place .
and with a low <unk> more about quality to do .
one of my favorite examples is <unk> .
there 's a best-selling book now you have all , that it ai average person we had in germany , in austria , about the tens of things in the domestic chores .
you can of time to count .
and you are two years ago , three generations , tens of things had , had , personnel .
the have to the manage .
we must have to deal .
and , fewer people come with , with these all options .
and we need a raising , of us that helps , of us and <unk> with these few things falling interest .
if only ' , get ' i really interesting , maybe is also still a habit of the spacecraft 's go , think , i , no , tens of things .
the next example is use instead of .
a real construction boom .
the star , <unk> , <unk> has to sort maybe twenty years ago , somehow , in alternative you were evolved .
in the meantime , use it always more people , if you to <unk> thinking .
if you to <unk> thinking .
instead , business models that easy to work , where do you the things , that we 've got this beautiful <unk> here , the a few hundred years was built still a sort of and still about the other centuries , to use it 's about the end .
this , even invested was just better to use .
this is the end , as a question of justice .
i showed you before , how profoundly unequal , that 's take them that as a picture association between africa and europe and a a fair world .
so that all the same with these resources economy can 's only then it possible , if we really can use less .
and that means that 's not less about quality , because of us has been sort to be much .
but it 's an important to the economy , the businesses , these products , those services . it 's available to imagine that we need to us a good life to do with a much less resources .
last point , that has also something with the big going to do <unk> after the growth , <unk> ' i was the time .
if you a little attention to the projections to read , it 's been back from below oecd , <unk> , now that <unk> every week are these projections are back down to <unk> .
it means , a crisis that 's in the door to my view , and after the , what we are , very much with the economists have been talking and with have , here are the numbers for austria , you find that it for all countries growth , just down to .
and there 's no reason for the growth to have , so , as i thought that from my youth , from the 1960 , you know .
for part has this in math reasons .
one point five percent growth is so much like eight percent growth , fifty years .
and that eight percent is that , what china today .
that are also about there , where we may , fifty years .
in general , if the pie bigger is , of course that it 's still , eight percent <unk> .
this one percent is still much , so we will be good living .
but you must be wondering , sort you put up , that is , not even if we are zero percent growth would have , i would that , the next year , that much longer producing and consume and incomes , as in this year .
that we can , and so we can work .
that 's also why not that wrong , because these statistics you know , the show that growth on long been , not more with the quality .
the economy grows , but the quality of stays in , we countries , about the state , we are .
and the way , jobs are also , without growth as possible and this is not that deeply connected together , that 's like us , of <unk> and how they all you give you will .
so that is simply not and then to you also time with the rise to deal .
and it comes , and increasingly , that , also <unk> as a more or next week , think , i , in coming in the trend , a larger story with that start on , through .
already <unk> has to have edward <unk> , the day , nobel peace in his <unk> so i asked myself , that he has said , the good life the good business , the good economy <unk> <unk> the good life .
it 's about the end , and not to not primarily to the returns to create , not primarily to grow to do for our countries do n't even more about .
for the peru , and these countries , for china , for india there is that a very different story .
and this is the only then they are also under <unk> , if we there are , still growing , let and we just sort on this level , on this high level , we 're good on life and economies .
and it 's also , politics .
it needs action goals .
it takes some indicators , say that economists .
it does n't just sort of this growth , but we should actually look , and measure and ask , what 's actually flavored with the quality , up the to ?
is the down ?
and also our politicians to measure .
of course , as high , is the <unk> ?
how does it sort of them together ?
we need a essentially the fundamental aspect of is , the <unk> finally able to tax avoidance and not the work .
who of them in the entrepreneurs of you , but also the employees , you know that very well .
what sort of control someone walk away , we know all times a colleague , paid .
and that could you very differently .
the resources are sort of reduces and so among the resources , tax avoidance and not the work .
and you have to the end of <unk> bring to something like to to <unk> to save them , health , infrastructure , without growth .
this is , but it 's nothing to you sort of a little better .
that is , so , more or less , on all levels it in this way to work , will , we can be hard , we can be a company with the products , services as a consumer sort of us to ask , what we actually , who do that what 's sort good for us ?
what we need and what we may not ?
the politics and vote , the framework set .
a couple of evidence , i was given .
and the end of course , the science <unk> percent of fellow is still in the direction , how we can that grow up ?
so , but nobody ever done .
if you the projections look if you the development can look at the last 20 years , it 's always streaming down to because it 's not about .
the politics does n't and the fellow will not growth to create , but this is the question how we go , got to , which is true that we have a good life of ?
so , <unk> 's do it .
be the <unk> you <unk> to lake .
with heart , the brain , your hand , and the end , the spirit , we will have to do .
thank you .
i 'm <unk> <unk> .
and i love this town .
this city has been so many stories to tell .
one of that has to a few hundred years happened .
and has to do with creative problem-solving .
on this creative problem-solving , i enter the same , and the story that later .
they will have to deal with the citadel <unk> .
this is a <unk> , the here in the middle of this city is , and so much of this city , mind , and does .
one another story before .
it was on a hot summer in reno and , nevada .
a man is , once in his shoes , so , that it right <unk> .
that him to it 's warm .
he 's europeans , he knows that 's not so with the heat .
he does so one he pulls the shoe of it takes a knife <unk> also do n't have some stuff in , which is a power and lots of holes in .
he pulls the shoe back to be there be a knifing a way , and notice he has a climate in shoe .
it 's the shoe , the breathing , born .
and this number , that you see here is the show in the <unk> of these billionaires are on the mario <unk> is today .
a company is <unk> born , with four letters .
the a or another couple of you know it .
he has the original idea nike even and adidas are offered .
both have been refused .
so he says , well , <unk> , i do my own business .
<unk> it goes on the stock market .
about today , several thousand people in just three hundred of businesses in about <unk> countries in the world .
so much to the creative problem-solving .
why not something to reinvent , which still not there is ?

if you <unk> still do n't know , it is for what is this is an opportunity ?
this question that has i 've often did , in a tough .
if something has gone wrong is , or my collaborator <unk> me or engineering n't work or what .
<unk> , little fuzzy memory , <unk> .
what is this is an opportunity ?
and , you get from <unk> into <unk> .
what the difference can <unk> ' i do with this example here to illustrate .
and a different example , was of the <unk> <unk> now , which is the <unk> any of <unk> .
and the evidence , like creative people who can be , if it to their own your insurance will go .
i want you a few examples here show .
that are so in fact that was at the <unk> <unk> and that has it also a commercial .
i <unk> ' the awesome .
my son has the woman does n't <unk> .

or i had the whole day , plant is where when i way , the epidemic peaked , grew up a sudden , picks up in my view , and i could this other car will not see more .
very clearly , who 's one is , right ?
the boonies .
the <unk> are <unk> .
i 'm <unk> been , and two , almost died .
because they can send me , but at least that half <unk> on .
the last thing i was at the crash was n't blame .
one was the young woman in <unk> .
if you 're a man , is , every one another explanation , do .
if you , but a woman who are , you know about it anyway .
so people are creative , we 're creative .
and i wish , and i dream of them , that we all the more of creativity to use .
many of us are in a <unk> <unk> .
and this must n't be that .
why not things just passed , do differently ?
old stuff , that we do , the one , from become are , that we might have the job or <unk> , as opposite .
why the not just passed , do differently , that <unk> , as a little simple <unk> .
and there 's so <unk> company , the use this .
for example <unk> , the have yet these <unk> of their by standing , these signs , or at the wall , for example , and there it then perhaps something so on .
also a way , right ?
well , the coffee pot to stay in spite of the <unk> .
or so what .
we have n't put wifi , <unk> you .
is yes , today , regular experience , right ?
if you the phone , not something you can .
or eat them at me , all of starvation , we both .
you have , but as creative .
so we need something 's .
i only ' one of the client or an the then go , and say , okay , that i like .
this <unk> ' i .
a german <unk> has in the should do the current day <unk> , and it in <unk> .
once the sport , the current news , once upon politics .
if you there 's three on the loo was , is you <unk> .
even got the complaint about to long <unk> the food .
it 's a <unk> building and this restaurant , very small , so i had the chefs take all shook hands of business .
it was to be closely .
the have thought , collectively , what we do ?
how we 're solving the problem ?
we ca n't pick up to be in the kitchen .
this is to form .
on every table is a it <unk> <unk> set of fresh <unk> salt , pepper , and a <unk> .
so , that your mind . an environment in the waiting on it to eat their <unk> have time -- they 're able to .
it the time different .
a creative idea , and perhaps , the <unk> solved .
there 's a person is the power , are currently not just a popular .
you that person is the leader in the <unk> , so the <unk> the <unk> .
and now <unk> yes , the german , very much .
already the second day , this is still on monday , so four days .
a company has <unk> <unk> the staff of the month 's chosen , and you know you may already , which .
a <unk> says , rather <unk> , we thank you .
the people come to us to book <unk> .
the bus who are full , it 's <unk> the time , people together , in a carpool , because each of course , after another , because it , of a to b to come .
but why do n't time , currently experiencing something we use , and creatively from his great thing to do ?
sometimes it happens , creativity also <unk> .
and it comes from a <unk> maybe it , just like this company , that you might .
so we have , you know that , which at the <unk> n't really goes well , but that they 're looking at the <unk> also been too have is , a one-in-three chance .
or the <unk> in the car .
there , we know , the different , <unk> , and all possible directions .
yes .
why , not a piece from the car on , if you <unk> it ?
or at <unk> there 's also have , the creative , but to make .
and all that has to do it with humor , with happiness , sometimes it 's stupid , <unk> ?
sometimes it 's funny .
once was my <unk> son , in my office .
and sitting on this <unk> me .
so , we have multiple <unk> around the <unk> .
and then he 'll turn from left to right , and it has come , and i held in the stinking <unk> say , to the you , listen , this is yes , not a playground here .
he said to me , look at me , big eyes , the playground .
and the moment , <unk> ' i actually has it right , right ?
why is not a playground today ?
why is that , what we do , not the playground for adults ?
that if only , but very much more sense , right ?
if we sort of these are , if we our talents to use , do that , what we like to do .
and excellence for , but the way .
that appear to is that , if a particular day on the week from then it changes , what in our brains .
it 's the first day in the week , and it 's our focus on a different .
so one another day we usually prefer to .
so in the weekend .
this sounds , yes , already in the media .
on thursday 's called `` yes , only still a day to the weekend .
or if then the most beautiful time of the year , announced it , the vacation .
what are then the rest <unk> weeks of the year ?
it 's dreadful ?
we 've all so awful , jobs ?
a <unk> it had a time on the front , this topic .
yeah , a monday , can ' i and the rest of life , you ask ourselves .
or on <unk> , on facebook , anywhere in the social networks is this issue up .
once was walking , i 'm going through the <unk> , one of the <unk> in <unk> .
there 's a lot of business and i took me that would like .
what have the so in the <unk> , there 's like ?
and one day , stuck i get in this business with these signs to buy .
and the first of the frill , that you see here , this is yes , quite a very nice .
so , of with so i do instead to work .
i <unk> that yes , i 'm a father of five kids , but i 'm also my work anymore .
yes .
or a <unk> for <unk> is that <unk> sign .
why that your mindset , the , because it becomes , which is increasingly , and on .
somebody a present time as an answer on this direction , posted it 's not the monday , it are your jobs .
and i wonder , even in fact , with the pink , glasses , this forward , and say , okay , ' time a shift .
what to my job is beautiful ?
this silly , is , let 's the pink , glasses , is , it looks at all right away from like before .
so something beautiful to talk , does this is beautiful , it 's clearly not .
the pink , glasses , is the way that 's good for bicycle on .
there holding them a wonderful , the fly , the otherwise , so the land were .
but to <unk> <unk> they do n't .
to this , if we do n't that change ?
actually the job , the content , our <unk> ?
within the company , outside , <unk> .
it ends , maybe in a system where we have that we feel like the mouse .
the mouse up a in this cycle , and running , and running , and there 's now , and eventually it 's to quickly , this cycle , it hits the mouse and you , their shoes out .
what makes the mouse , but it ?
you know , nothing else , you go back in , in the <unk> .
and again , and again and perhaps the movie , every day acknowledges me that <unk> you may all of them , soft .
that 's beautiful <unk> here with hay , so they do , yes , because failure and it goes and over again , so there .
and that , what we as funny and figure it 's probably has the mouse looking at once a concussion , yeah ?
or something needs it , that <unk> <unk> .
i went 's many years ago , so when i way discovered was one of students at home .
and at was wondering , so the street under , i felt it was very , black , my eyes and somehow got madd '' i stand by .
the next day i went to the doctor , because i thought , which is there on ?
he looked me and said , no way , is physically leave everything okay .
but how to look so <unk> from ?
and i looked in my calendar , to bring that test , and saw , i worked for three weeks , and somehow bugging me , the job .
after two years in the <unk> and collaborator , the first , in the early been wondering whether we the night before the conclusion .
i also thought , what 's actually would still for jobs ?
and i started , <unk> , again , other priorities straight to me , to look , that i time with my family <unk> , something good for me , which i 'm doing .
<unk> , whether it 's not a different <unk> there in my job , a small antenna .
i realized , the talks a large groups , that make me really joyful .
i do 'official ' , as a benign advice and <unk> and also other things , but those talks by pulses of giving to , so let me share , the prepare me really joyful .
and this was n't always like .
i was have you have that <unk> can get sick .
and sometimes it 's really this shot in the room experience , <unk> of me is it goes back from the hospital , i had been , after he 's a heart of out , and on , he starts as well , <unk> .
sooner than i said , you 're getting to die jogging , and it has always made me <unk> , you with your running and so .
now , it themselves .
so , with <unk> , beautiful slow , in real <unk> , but eventually we will also , jogging , go .
what ?
the bottom are we all the healthier .
the <unk> go down , but a curve , that goes , is the conditions , because of mental health .
<unk> minus four percent in the shrink the last 10 years , <unk> almost call minus fifty percent , that 's beautiful , this is less .
rise of psychiatric disorders , plus from one percent .
this is something , where i think , to reduce this to be ?
why is that ?
this is just in austria , that ?
no , in germany , it 's .
<unk> , <unk> , this is all the healthier .
this is so here on the left-hand side to recognize .
very bottom , psychiatric disorders , plus eight hundred percent in the last 10 years , finds a a big german <unk> out .
the number <unk> four- , to .
also the cost .
and it 's think , all kinds of official , what we can do with this subject ?
do this -- sometimes form , it , involuntary <unk> , for example here .
so this is good meant .
and somebody has once said , no alcohol abuse is also not a solution .
but what is then the solution ?
what is then that , which gives us , but again , healthy the power and it , and with happiness is ?
and that has made me the last years .
i thought , there 's something like <unk> , it 's something that even though there ?
i figure , the job is not that , what we <unk> it , and happy to do .
there 's many other things , that are important , family , health , think , and so forth .
but in fact is yet , that we the the most of our <unk> in the work on .
and if we do that , then why not that do , that it gives us , that has been troubling , and also by anything else .
the <unk> <unk> ' i do you <unk> '' self-indulgent guesswork than the last still there is like to <unk> and for <unk> this .
these little had no , that you 'll hopefully then to realize it .
<unk> is for a talent to execution , and freedom .
that is , how <unk> ' i mean , talents ?
in the environment , ' i think that , with whom ?
the freedom . i ' i 'm here , to do that , what i want to do ?
because it 's the degree of <unk> , of us <unk> .
the more of them , more and more stress .
and what i do this ?
do that .
that are these four areas .
and it can everyone for yourself to have the test .
i had this for me putting yourself doing with a few years and i do this is constantly , .
can i mean , talents to use ?
in the environment ?
and that is , sometimes i go in a coffee with my laptop , to the seminar prepare , or a <unk> .
freedom .
the freedom , i can take to bring that do , what i 's important .
and do i do it also ?
do that .
the last ted u .
and then there 's , people , the me explain why do n't that goes .
and why this at them much harder .
then i usually very happy to an answer to this point .
who wants to find ways .
who do n't , has the reasons .
and by the point , you can do to choose <unk> ' i devised ways , `` get ' i devised ways , or i ' i reasons why ?
and they 're in both right .
what do with our talents somewhere else ?
each of them has his great <unk> around .
that is yes , much to small .
that 's filled with the same talent , with the gold , with all kinds , with their skills .
what do this ?
by the end we ask this .
or if we in hospital 're really , or the end of life .
what i started with my talent done ?
the way , who 's like it has on <unk> <unk> , you 'd like that there 's still access .
so , what do with our talents , is so my first question , i used to me putting yourself , and it every day .
<unk> ' i the good enough ?
and resources .
there was yet another thing with a story .
that i wanted to tell about <unk> .
and that <unk> ' i looked at the point is still do .
this fortress which was the rescue center for the <unk> as a shrink five hundred years , the enemies came out .
and the enemies , we realized that these fortress , so well , built was that , you do n't take them .
thick walls sixties ways , the <unk> to the fortress , which is the doors , <unk> , can see on .
i was <unk> at .
so we thought . here , okay if we do n't get , then we form a <unk> .
we let 's no more out and in .
time looking at how long , that there , endurance .
the <unk> it was from long until the day came , where the supplies , consumes .
they had only still a <unk> the was already on the way to , slaughtered humanely raised to be as the <unk> at the bishop crowther , says , the bishop give me that <unk> and give me three days .
bishop crowther , <unk> , you 've got you the time , i <unk> , you , come , take the <unk> and help us .
<unk> goes with the <unk> way .
on even see it down the enemies , how about the wall of the citadel a <unk> pulled it is led , from left to right and already in the early .
well , thinking . , a <unk> , what is that already .
it is to double-lock .
again is a <unk> <unk> , the top of wall around the fortress , this is it , black .
enemies are thinking about is , oh , the still has two <unk> , it can ' , take .
the night i did the scenario of the time , this is he knows the <unk> , the there , and from here is led .
the second day , after the six different <unk> have seen the bottom , they pulled in a <unk> .
because they thought , and that takes us to long , that we think we have n't anymore .
and then went to the <unk> down to <unk> and <unk> the <unk> .
the one , they had and so , if you <unk> .
that are the <unk> <unk> to form .
i like this idea , that all right there is , what we need , and that we have anything .
sometimes we 're it from the resources , sometimes it 's not much , sometimes it 's a little bit .
but also requires that can actually , we do something .
we have no idea of the power , that we have the world every day 's putting ourselves .
and if you think , and that could now a good <unk> be then you have right .
in the spring from the spring .
the coming .
and we in <unk> know there is the snow , because it 's getting there 's the plants . of branches brown <unk> to green <unk> .
there are blooms eventually come out of those blooms fruits .
there are apple here 's very popular strategies that we then we harvest and eat .
there 's grain of corn we can then the ground and the bread that laborious .
because there any animals , the eat .
there 's people , the then the products that it later , food .
and it 's automatically .
but when you think about that perhaps not that we automatically join everything is then it 's a fear and so anxious .
and obviously this is this threat , maybe just very ambiguous and also very theoretically , but just in the blooms , the connection of the flower to plant are bees , a very , huge role .
there 's research , the show that , to <unk> percent of our food , certain foods we do n't there were if we do n't make bees have .
also that sounds like , so <unk> at because it 's normal for us is , and we need bees might also not that sense .
there 's now some time ago , a very interesting movie , <unk> , to talk .
and i recommend you , you look at it .
now , but look forward , we went on the lord <unk> the universe is just with honeybees are working , the in his high school , in <unk> the importance of bees were much power .
that he doing here in school at <unk> and he 's going to us now some of his work to tell .
please , mr. <unk> .
yes , good evening .
first time , a big thanks to mr. <unk> and at the whole <unk> .
that i 'm here with my project , <unk> specifically <unk> contribute something you can think about the life of bees .
and that still under one wing of <unk> about a little <unk> to tell the fun .
because i think to give me , the most of you <unk> in the same factors . it was very well , tonight is a <unk> company , you in eighteen minutes in the basics of beekeeping in new ways to .
that do i do n't no .
but maybe that 's me , you to get that they <unk> start to love or a certain amount of empathy to them to develop and you to engage for this <unk> youth-led , <unk> insect in the bee .
my name is thomas <unk> , i 'm <unk> years of young when i 'm with an incredible wife annie perasa married , father of five children still not <unk> and have different <unk> and <unk> finished and been working <unk> years in the <unk> with <unk> adolescents and adults .
i 'm a member in <unk> <unk> and in charity <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
and work now in the <unk> <unk> top of <unk> with our eldest people whose students in <unk> .
we 're working there in the garden , in the modern agriculture and in the urban beekeeping .
<unk> is yes , actually a play of <unk> <unk> and act of <unk> <unk> .
our personal flying classroom is to a <unk> , a quiet , a steady thing .
and you is also to calm .
it 's almost a <unk> issue .
and do n't have been the ancient greeks the relationship between the honey , so <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> know .
and in a wonderful little verse of homer , he describes how the <unk> <unk> his <unk> to the sleeping poet , go out to inspire , it to go back with dense web .
but the <unk> go up to do n't find yourself , but they send her blue are bees and <unk> now the poet the lips , to wax and we crawl in the mouth and go and out with him later , the words like the honey from the <unk> flow .
a gorgeous image .
hopefully you get me that tonight is .
yes .
this flying classroom .
i come to the project .
one of <unk> , this <unk> the men 's now my students with me , have built up for 30 kilometers until <unk> days in a <unk> .
in the neighboring schools of us in <unk> into school , or in the <unk> in the college of <unk> or in the <unk> to <unk> .
a <unk> to <unk> or in classrooms will we had in <unk> .
the teacher , the project that accompanied that goes up with me in the class , and we 're looking for a , put in place for that in a <unk> .
most of the window to the kids that can see during this month .
and , all things , with the bees , the then in there are by the hose out and again <unk> .
there is then the window of the slot .
so .
and then finally beginning of the experience with me on the <unk> .
i 'm so a <unk> and <unk> ' right away from a term <unk> two <unk> out and <unk> you 're now here in these <unk> in .

also important , we have here <unk> their , and here to the edge of the fresh their be , so fresh eggs .
and then you also a <unk> , up here .
there 's the honey .
the need them , if , bad weather is , and they do n't fly .
so .
this is then .
then there 's the <unk> here again on and begins immediately the transportation depended on the for <unk> where , or at the for <unk> place in the school .
and now start seeing something wonderful .
i mean , ladies and gentlemen , these bees in there the then in the class are going to experience of a crisis .
her people 's made us .
they are lonely .
they find your queen 's not .
and this is the most important task from <unk> , when he this <unk> -- that he put more attention , the queen , in ancient people are left .
that not so on these two <unk> sitting .
and they 're sad , these bees .
they 're starting to <unk> .
yes , the <unk> says , they <unk> .
you hear that .
they just sums up almost a <unk> higher than if you normally in your <unk> with a queen 's coming together .
and now starting a <unk> .
i mean , ladies and gentlemen , in a night , they develop all right now the necessity , a new people to start , and the whole thing happened without <unk> , <unk> , without conferences , without having , opinions and post-doc positions .
there is the people to agree and it used then in the first night is a <unk> .
because without the queen going to this came after six weeks . there .
because <unk> lives only six weeks .
so .
and in this first night , get them from one of <unk> a pin it requires an egg , and bring that in this <unk> in .
and there <unk> to be downloaded a queen .
everybody , the of you <unk> in the high was , says , how to do that go ?
yes , we genetically <unk> , is yet all genetically <unk> .
this is true .
and now start seeing something wonderful .
that is an egg , what 's normally in the <unk> an entirely unlike would have been going in the <unk> a queen .

and then it will be fed by a <unk> <unk> .
right , you .
and instantly it changes , on this <unk> on <unk> imagine the genetic code .
the <unk> going through the <unk> in the <unk> <unk> changed .
we had that i have time i heard that , what we eat , that determines , what kind of us .
and at the queen is that really wonderful to experience .
three days , egg , five days <unk> .
and that can the students all witness .
you see that in class .

no , that happens <unk> .
i mean , ladies and gentlemen , that 's a <unk> or a <unk> decision .
and then count the students to eight days before each of my student knows , three , five times eight a queen 's doing so <unk> days that the queen <unk> .
and the day , if that and so happen to , the teachers has that wrote in the <unk> there <unk> the nightstand to with students , the morning to five o'clock , yeah .
and then he says the mother , say , which is because with you go ?
yes , i got in school .
yes , why that ?
yes , our queen <unk> .
yeah ?
and then we are the morning to six in the school .
and then hit the to their <unk> down at this <unk> , because you witness to , like this queen 's now <unk> .
and if you that really can experience then you first thing .
this queen 's whistling .
so .
still a little bit higher .
and then , the <unk> and cut out that the queen going free .
the first , what that the queen , they spread her wings come out and there are now with their <unk> that people what do to have a queen i pulled that has another through their , you <unk> , they think of pheromones .
the nation has now again an identity .
now are three to five days for those queen is fed orally .
of the <unk> front get them their <unk> <unk> .
the back from the high out , from the populace , from this <unk> .
and after five days , and going to that the queen 's one of <unk> out .
some think now , i have time ever seen , like a <unk> in <unk> .
you know , stop .
what different .
-- that we let me .
this queen the flying now by ourselves without <unk> , without the guards , from this <unk> out to two miles high .
they have surely must have time ever seen in the zeppelin .
in the <unk> , and it 's in an <unk> now <unk> , of seven to 12 drones , the kind of bees .
so the way , like in islam , where the man , different women have to be here is the queen , the seven to 12 , men .
and this whole thing happening in a wonderful way in flight .
the drone will come back of <unk> these queen , and this queen of it now in an flight all that , what you look at the seeds will need to for three years eggs to put them .
for the drone is it also a an amazing experience .
if you 's done with the <unk> you kill them and of dead by the sky .
and then there 's the queen goes back and starts , eggs to put them .
it 's always a , two students in the class , it immediately see .
the also see immediately the queen .
yes .

and then come , i one night , then you had to this <unk> .
<unk> ' that <unk> of the outside , and the next morning <unk> ' i do this <unk> with the queen and these bees to me on the <unk> .
and here you 're still the queen .
yes .
but then <unk> .
and vague , 10 to 12 <unk> .
and then it 's this , these two <unk> are now here in a <unk> .
in a full stick , in a particular prey and now can this note the big and they 're going .
why are bees in the school ?
i mean , ladies and gentlemen , the kids that have experienced , forget that never more .
yes .
there is yes , not only true that in this class , then the students all the time with the bees are together , but the entire school is yes , in this class in .
and the teacher , when it 's something you know , when it 's something can , when he when he said , there something for has the can a history , and after the other people .
you look , bees and a century ago <unk> years we have a cave paintings , where the people have the honey and it .
a few months , you have in israel environment , <unk> found in which the people at the bees thought .
any human culture has to bees , breakup .
or vice versa , the bees were at any culture .
in china , in india in persia , in egypt , in greece , in rome .
all they were in .
the human cultures , ladies and gentlemen , are passed .
he can a <unk> , a <unk> hook , he can a <unk> join .
i mean , ladies and gentlemen , you know , which by , or grafting trees , the bees <unk> , what they need ?
that they get out there are now , something to find , now in summer of agriculture .
this out there , this is a green desert for our bees .
yeah ?

how long , they 're on the individuals are blooms ?
and how long , they need , until they come back .
he can be downloaded a <unk> hold .
how <unk> i a hexagon ?
yes .
you know , whether this is , in the <unk> the top , is , or a flat on , is ?
a look exactly .
he can a math -- , a <unk> join .
yes , ladies and gentlemen , he can with students , even the <unk> <unk> on these <unk> explore .
and then it comes to the question , was karl from newly <unk> the nobel prize in getting ?
because he thought , it has to the bees can see that in the beehive .
but , ladies and gentlemen , in a hive , it 's <unk> .
that 's also a bee has nothing .
and just the professor <unk> , the many years in <unk> at the university students a has the has in <unk> figured , the bees , there a <unk> create the individual <unk> .
as a <unk> net of the wax in the <unk> a <unk> create , and now with <unk> hertz , their <unk> there , or deliver , and the bees , the <unk> , the up with their legs , with their <unk> .
you see , what these bees in the school ?
it 's <unk> par <unk> , and the kids lose your fear , the bees .
and develop an awareness for the bees .
they learn , <unk> , look , what the bees do .
and they get a warning , these creatures which in this just for us who lives .
the bees to wax still not , a 70 pounds per people in the year .
now , for <unk> years , the only way , candles at making .
they 're at the budding out at the trees that <unk> .
this is a <unk> , <unk> them their people .
and now imagine you try to time ago , in summer , that are their sixties , , <unk> bees on this is a narrow pitch black room , <unk> degrees .
hey , there 's the infectious diseases , without end .
no , at the bees do n't .
because they have in this <unk> natural antibiotics .
they accumulate the pollen , and so , you to him <unk> , he 's about the <unk> , one on <unk> .
someone , the at the <unk> get is , pneumonia <unk> , <unk> the can now to a <unk> go and a <unk> 'll let , he the <unk> from the people <unk> .
of course , there 's a grid , and with <unk> with a <unk> and so , because they did n't happen .
yeah , and then i mean , ladies and gentlemen , that pollinating the <unk> do that the bees course , and we have fewer and apples , if the bees are there is n't fly would sooner or we have to be like the chinese men 's the <unk> <unk> and they themselves locally .
there 's much more these interrelations .
you look at the <unk> , there on the pasture , is the also the growing on the meandering stream , where the cows graze again .
and there are flying through the bee , i 've got to their nectar and it 's fermented -- these <unk> .
and now comes the cow and down the <unk> and just , because they <unk> <unk> pick up , they can digest .
yeah ?
and then <unk> you go back and notice , ah , i <unk> <unk> , ah , i can do it again <unk> .
and then there 's milk .
that makes the bee .
yeah ?
and to last but not get the bee keeping us that most valuable , what it on the from the nature , there .
the honey .
i still just to the point to come <unk> .
my students to be wondering , every year when you this <unk> build and then you know , and with me together in the schools .
that 's now , not my <unk> but , i had a student debt and so , i said , <unk> in school in <unk> and i said , you , <unk> , put you get yourself .
and then he says , yes , i 'll get down , <unk> <unk> .
i come from <unk> at <unk> and i 'm 20 years .
and i 've been five years in <unk> and for two years , thomas in <unk> .
and i 'm , let me , that i now . with the <unk> learn to , but with the hands can learn .
<unk> , with her head .
and a <unk> went through the <unk> , <unk> school .
and more than half the said , oh yeah , that we want .
my students see here 's an incredible global appreciation and the put between , in quotes , normal and the theirs are going through the bees , salvaged .
the field to face . and they have confidence , my students and a proud .
how you go from the bee network ?
the question is wrong .
you have to say , how is to <unk> the <unk> ?
and because i think , i , it 's the person , the other people <unk> and he 's a new <unk> there .
and he says , so , start with it .
but at a poem from <unk> of <unk> .
who like the bee would be the sun shining through the <unk> feel the way to flower will find and never the way out of the opposite sides of the fields in <unk> glory of how quickly he also lived , he would n't cry .
thank you .
hello , love her friends in god .
so welcome to show , my project .
this project i was a person and my wife .
it 's the fight for a very end of the female genital mutilation .
in my eyes that 's greatest crimes of humanity , because it their been five thousand years .
the society against the women with still six to have a day .
first <unk> ' i imagine .
my name is <unk> , i come from hamburg .
and i <unk> years a <unk> .
you can do to think that i on the job , not <unk> .
and i feel not <unk> .
and that i was glad that i said in the subject <unk> well <unk> and exciting amounts of cross .
for this .
with a massive <unk> about the atlantic ocean of africa , after brazil .
the sail a plea on the <unk> brazil in the demise of genocide on the last live indians from the <unk> , to stop .
that was a ride , where i more <unk> was as <unk> , more <unk> as <unk> .
yet we were these large amounts of a match , the ages of the media to find and even a small person as i was his cause the world to the language into .
<unk> i started with their own caravan across the <unk> in ethiopia <unk> .
then there was there 's war between eritrea , and ethiopia and we were <unk> these sweet .
and despite all the cruelty , that we were experiencing , we got to the other side that are beginning to hospitality of <unk> , the us into <unk> , arab hospitality .
and once it was that we busted down by and our two guards , that you see here , with their bodies as living up in front of us <unk> , and the insulting said that are my an environment .
if you the killing you want you by us through it shoot .
something similar , i was in not another culture .
and then in boys , you 've learned , that you conceptualize islam , not can reduce the terrorism .
, christians , yes , not be reduced in their terrorism .
for the <unk> .
the inquisition , the <unk> .
but rather on the true value , how to charity , social responsibility that <unk> .
these are the values , for the way . it 's worthwhile to fight .
after many years , i came back in this <unk> been , with my wife <unk> .
and there were we then , from this <unk> female genital mutilation .
when i then i heard that , nine-tenths of everyday victims <unk> are the rest 're christians and <unk> got madd '' i thought about how can a <unk> like the islam , besides all of terror , that still <unk> in the shoes i do so let me ?
and the idea was the top leaders because of islam to get the need to sin to understand .
we 're looking for in terms in german organizations , that we have n't find it .
because we had to us , but now we would be yes , completely <unk> , of islam is n't <unk> .
you 'd like me to the throat and .
on <unk> of amnesty , and internationally , then we have <unk> our own conservation organization , started .
and they were kind of <unk> and <unk> independently .
and to now this battle , even get to can we needed the images .
it was a scarcity .
and therefore i moved <unk> and i go back in this desert to collaborate with the hidden camera , these pictures .
the bad as a bloody images , that i show you do n't , but i want to the crime , drawing .
girl , the age of four weeks , and on to the marriage will be some of their parents and family , picked , on the earth , put you sit down to the limbs , and you keep them without anesthesia , the clitoris and the <unk> ab up with a <unk> the <unk> to , without anesthesia , <unk> instruments , no knowledge of hygiene , and the anatomy and the <unk> to attenuate this .
what you 've left is a small aperture of the size of <unk> .
for a minuscule part , a 15 minutes .
if they typically tell you ask him to do these two weeks .
we never been destroyed . their bodies and soul , denied of would .
that the beginning was the so-called <unk> <unk> .
in the virgins it on .
the man to you open .
he still has never a <unk> she saw .
the uncle , he said , oh , ibrahim , is , no problem .
you 're rubbing your penis , <unk> a and then one or you very hard .
and if you do n't it says , is also not bad .
and then take sal you that knife and <unk> the panels .
this is <unk> <unk> .
and dies a third of the girls .
that you had three months ago for .
now , for shock has the girl puts his language .
these are the <unk> , some in asia .
the most are a hindu house by kublai khan .
and when you look , we are muslims have asked , why you did this ?
she was the <unk> answer , that we have to do , this is in the koran .
nothing is in the koran that , very the opposite .
everybody , believing <unk> five times per day in prayer , one <unk> , the creator , is , perfectly , <unk> .
but they do n't seem to believe , what you there praying .
they imply <unk> , a <unk> to be the women 's wrong , has created and why you now as <unk> human being so prepotent be able to women <unk> .
but now we had the images of the first ted fellow collaborator was this <unk> .
he <unk> us , his whole <unk> <unk> to a conference .
there 's hard and discussions , for two days .
but we had the health in our side , the highest <unk> on our side .
and the thing that , the practice is against all rights , against the religion , we need to him one .
as recently that has the way <unk> this new <unk> signed .
and if you africa and the <unk> know , you know you , just that has to these are valid .
and it was being celebrated , and these successes , we had actually , in other countries .
quick example from now , <unk> there <unk> us the highest pragmatically , the <unk> of his message , that 's a crime is , on <unk> to write and that now in the <unk> to place .
for weeks , we were the way , with your <unk> .
a hundred <unk> we had in .
and where we came , we 've just open your ears , open arms and the historical sayings , saints hospitality -- experienced .
and when we do this country , eventually leaving me to think , `` the great scholar and <unk> <unk> , you want now really all <unk> countries to happen ?
so much lifetime will <unk> you 're not anymore .
he 's right .
i 'm <unk> , you have to slow to the thing .
and so , he had an idea .
he said , if you can really , the ten <unk> muslims , the world at a table to enter and the reason for the need to sin , then it 's a sin .
<unk> and i went to the cairo , in the <unk> and -- a mosque to the vatican , the <unk> .
and the <unk> for <unk> quite the <unk> , his <unk> professor , doctor , ali <unk> we got a <unk> .
he listened to the idea . i was thrilled , especially , when we his notion that we finance this would .
and that we do it 's about medical provider , the support us .
and then he said , i 'm going to the conference , not just <unk> , as we put it 's called to have , but i 'm going to the <unk> take .
and that he has done .
over cairo <unk> eventually , basically in <unk> our government transparent .
international <unk> to deal of <unk> of women 's body through the female .
the <unk> of <unk> professor , doctor , ali <unk> .
and all these are they did .
a hundred with guards , but the highest in the world .
in the middle <unk> of qatar , the man has <unk> in hamburg , and the rest of europe and he 's the cause of <unk> because of cartoons .
so men the life and death can decide .
but it 's also others .
the left the <unk> <unk> , right , the <unk> , my <unk> .
the highest in the world .
about where i 'm <unk> i only still a vacuum , and <unk> personally .
and then i did you all a place .
it started the conference .
and under our sign at the <unk> from left <unk> of egypt .
the <unk> <unk> the <unk> egypt , <unk> of that she was mubarak and <unk> <unk> , germany .
so much for the subject , of islam is not <unk> .
we had , and doctors , sent over the on their way of the time <unk> , as well , you women there will do , with the <unk> .
and then got <unk> your film to show , <unk> .
reality .
the men had wet eyes .
they moved to go back behind closeted kind of doors to just two hours , you had decided , and a <unk> wrote , a <unk> .
the <unk> kick in the cameras , announced , what you decided to .
and the most important set it , was this .
female genital mutilation , is a <unk> crime , that , not our values of islam and it .
he 's an autograph the <unk> .
we thought , the job is done had , but the calculation even without our celibacy on the time .
because the shame , over the abdomen , the woman to talk , is more of them than any mind .
that we have <unk> .
we have that we have the conference , documented in this so-called `` golden rule book .

and because ali <unk> , the <unk> , it so well , i found , the book , and it has a `` to blessed .
it gets us from the hands of rent .
we were in many countries had then at conferences on hold down with the parts of the highest clergy like .

unfortunately , but i 've got the most not the courage to put that , well , to announce that .
over the abdomen , the woman you 're not in the mosque to talk .
just some have the courage to put them .
they 're at least in the universities , you go , on <unk> .

and then it goes out of speakers in the <unk> .
and that are , the individuals .
that will it spread .
but i 'm going to the time .
it are all drop in the hot rocks , and that i 'm working on many other strategy , this topic . <unk> .
the practice , aimed .
but my <unk> that would this .
i want to the great message the highest clergy like the world . announce the birthplace of islam is here at the kaaba , in mecca .
not at that <unk> <unk> <unk> , but in the <unk> .
if there 's four million people come together , men and women <unk> islamic currents .
then <unk> ' i do with all of and the <unk> king of my transparent up there 's between the minarets if you .
how i do this already passed , trained to have in the <unk> .
unfortunately , i 've not yet -- the last <unk> , that would be the <unk> king .
but i 'm sure , when he said of <unk> he would join .
for a to these women to help .
the other , to the time to show , which the true value of islam , are , instead , are constantly going to them .
from terrorists than <unk> .
if i do n't that do then <unk> ' i may have this , in hamburg , you had .

and we transparent and if you .
and maybe i experience i do it still , that little girl , his daughters . <unk> to .
then has to my life that 's worth it .
and i appeal to each , the this now it has seen or has , to join me .
also not join it is a <unk> .
we have the practice in the ton of some , otherwise , i kick it is kind of this stage , still not .
and now i want to conclude the concept of my <unk> , even show .
this is my <unk> , my <unk> .

down there we have it , in german .
female genital mutilation , the koran , and the ethic of islam , incompatible .
you is <unk> and one of discrimination of islam .
thank you .
thank you .
so , i 'm actually , so that time .
so we looked at the <unk> out , that you a refugee now in germany would get .
the <unk> attention <unk> have my mother , my brother and i was the first times as a package <unk> .
and , it <unk> .
my mom was completely terrified , because they did n't have , why the us now rotten food for granted .
the third day we have finally got aware .
we were the trash to this stuff back to throw away then got a <unk> wife and trade that easy to <unk> .
they tried to allow us to explain , hey , that you can eat .
this is not before ripened .
that tastes , very well .
it 's the cheese .
my mother was the brow up and we were laughing .
cheese .
in my homeland , we 've talked about it <unk> but the has not so <unk> smell .
i 'm <unk> <unk> and <unk> years old .
now , for fifteen years , i came to my mother and my brother of china to germany fled .
this kind of escape <unk> ' i tell ourselves now .
but all , it 's going to me about , to the people that run out how to have and to a success did .
but first i could use , i them , where i just come from .
i 'm <unk> .
<unk> are a little <unk> , the northwest of china life .
and this region is from the chinese that autonomous area <unk> .
it 's about <unk> miles of the germans go away .
in china to live in 10 million <unk> but in munich , is the biggest <unk> community of china .
and this <unk> life , so here because we in china under constant , human rights have to .
hundreds of chinese were trying to get to <unk> moved to `` in our own home to a minority become aware .
our own native language , <unk> was out of education system so much .
in schools and in university will only still in chinese students .
and our religion can we also not free to act .
the <unk> losing so their culture and identity .
and if we have to anyone with is , and for the right to the <unk> , a risk a long sentences , torture , or even die .
this was also the reason , why my parents , for you 've decided , with us kids to escape .
this was <unk> and i was 11 years old .
this picture is short , of escape from .
we did n't enough money , so my father had first time behind .
i <unk> ' at me many people , the us in the run have helped .
i <unk> ' at me many images .
i <unk> , let me , but first to <unk> our <unk> <unk> .
i just know , it right now , for me , when i my eyes <unk> .
he was big had downloaded a <unk> at , and we met him , with his little lada on a lot .
the first rate was to vomit .
i know , that many a negative image of <unk> have to the only do business plan to refugees abuse and wondering , not for the fates are interested .
but i '' , say , i '' , it as <unk> call , not as <unk> .
because <unk> us has conducted months of .
he was the airport in <unk> on a <unk> and has to the last thing <unk> , whether we also really sure , through the <unk> came out .
the airport in <unk> we got there . and i still , as my mother got to me she 's just turned out of the airport .
turns out to you do n't happen .
until we are out .
because i did it in my hand a pass , and there was also my photo in but there was a total stranger name , <unk> .
i had a <unk> through the <unk> .
and i <unk> ' at me <unk> <unk> the me at he had my watch out in the hand .
silence .
and sweat .
a long view .
we were at <unk> .
in munich , <unk> ' i look at a lot of the first responders , the us some very strongly supported .
i <unk> , let me at the <unk> woman , the with us in <unk> used to .
in a <unk> with four <unk> per <unk> 13 family .
at least that 's the children .
a <unk> and a kitchen .
it was stranger whose faces .
and many different languages .
and we did n't have privacy .
my mother , my brother and i had to us a <unk> share .
there was eating , you 've made and done homework .
friends were now , not to visit , because i <unk> , where we were .
it 's my <unk> the <unk> in the college , i knew them .
they knew my story and went to me very , and they took care , to me .
for example , got them to me <unk> <unk> what i now . do .
but they helped me , somehow , and were able to meet .
i spent my whole place where the <unk> .
this was for my mother 's not easy .
alone with us kids with her husband and always in the uncertainty , because we had , just a <unk> and they could now that was deported .
i <unk> , let me that , that i became very , aggressively , was to the time .
it 's me also slightly embarrassing , this now here 's all to tell , but now i must be easy to my story .
i was very , aggressive and i could tell me in the school at some way to focus .
the 1980s brought us to find out to the catholic <unk> where we the first time to normal young kids in contact with .
with a normal , my darlin ' i children , the not in a <unk> that had .
i <unk> , let me , at the <unk> the me and my brother . to so , or <unk> sent to have .
just so we bit out .
i <unk> , let me , on several <unk> <unk> the with us done homework have , because our parents did n't speak german , could .
or the have to us , just a painting .
we 've always very excited .
i still , how we always in the fence line up and waited until these people came , because , somehow were wondering , strangers when people for us time , and that was us at the important .
after two years , finally got my father to germany .
this problem was thinking , it to go directly from <unk> to <unk> deported was because it in munich , because we think is no more for him , there .
i <unk> , let me at the very , who she said that it has managed , my father , the <unk> to china to keep us they did it in fact , that he we had in munich , to inform me .
i <unk> , let me at this time where i really , and then you very , happy i was , because after six years <unk> were we finally in a place .
we got a <unk> for three years , and we had finally , a own apartment , your bad and one of your kitchen .
and i had actually a room .
it was it 's very small and i did n't have desk in , but it was good , i was my door in -- .
and i <unk> , let me that i the time , very well used to have , but i had yet the college , without a major leave .
i looked for me really no way .
there was a <unk> , the me in <unk> , which has and it 's still do with the idea that i think about the second and exposing and my degrees <unk> .
first <unk> then the <unk> .
i thank the teacher , the really at me thought , and i was really not easy to the time to i do it 's actually going to the middle at that .
and i 'm going to <unk> .
and before i 'm going to <unk> , i played the way with my best friend <unk> at <unk> .
<unk> is an organization or a project of organized <unk> .
but i was n't a <unk> that got madd '' i also only done because we by <unk> a place had , where we simply could go .
we had a valve , what we <unk> <unk> could .
and the heads of <unk> helped us some way that we 're continuing problems to tell you could and he went to us and i could tell us in all wondering , somehow help .
and then i came to <unk> , <unk> .
and this is a project , where young people without a major in the opportunity to get , the artistic <unk> .
that has to me really very well done , and i realized , art is something which i was also a little <unk> .
by <unk> and the connect to <unk> got a filmmaker , on us .
he made the movie <unk> about the lives of my friends and me .
and the film he won lots of awards .
we realized , that people , for our story was interested .
he was a very special feeling , because we it still never had had , that people we were listening .
and that was like a moment , where i thought , okay .
i do n't want more did n't .
i want something comes from my life .
a collaborator of <unk> , a <unk> for refugees got me on the idea for a <unk> of the <unk> <unk> join .
but because i said in the bold , i get really makes had i ended up at random at a <unk> for a play and the title is <unk> one to four .
so i was just right .
i was playing with .
and this thing is , after a performance of the two editors , from <unk> broadcasting , on me <unk> .
and i had asked , if i do have just times its own <unk> .
i thought , super , the golden ticket .
it , ' i do with .
and i made for the radio <unk> , pulse <unk> and one of posts about a play <unk> . i also ourselves <unk> was for the european <unk> nominated vice versa .
and i told him , actually won .
now coming up , i look at the school for <unk> and movie munich <unk> , the third year , and i 'm <unk> the <unk> .
and all this would have to me to do n't have been possible if not one or organizations like <unk> or projects like <unk> well , for me being used to have .
they have to me , we did you have to me spaces were open , they have to me ways i’ve shown , i my place in the society , i <unk> .
and to come , i now .
each of you have the way , people like to help second chance to get and their lives or their place in the society .
because , the people , in every day come to shrink a hundred million refugees in munich , and each of you 're with hope and each of you have a huge potential .
they have it with great and determination to many terrible producer is behind it .
and with this determination , you could really big for profit for germany will be , and for every one of us .
and i could actually thousands of things tell , what you can do , but because i do n't even more than enough time , to have even though there it , a minute , synced its , i you a <unk> brought .
whip them now your shoes out they ca n't tell me tell is , they were no code <unk> .
we scan them the code of a and then they come on the side of <unk> with many possibilities , what they have no way .
and that would help us very good to help .
i thank me already now , for their engagement and we look out hope .
and then scan them the code .
i just know , it .
many have the phone , not in the hand .
you are so i 'm going to become , or what ?

more advertising .
this is a little advertising , the , i wrote . i .
feet .
rich enough to make vitamin c .
so the <unk> .
vitamin a toe .
already passed , very funny .
i want , a joke about the <unk> your girlfriend , say , but the punch it was just pretty flat .
yes , is not been on my <unk> .

yes .
thank you for a 's listening .
you were terrific .
thank you , ladies and gentlemen .
let me give you 'll begin with a <unk> question to start .
why would you <unk> actually do ?
i mean , everybody , the tax man used to try to ask , whether it at least some potentially of society , what you back .
the answer is very clear .
we know now , the life expectancy for at the birth , just to about <unk> percent of genetically <unk> is .
that means that 's going to any of environmental , <unk> give the impact on <unk> .
why we know it still so little ?
why are we were bombarded by <unk> messages from the <unk> , the , for part of each other on ?
you remember wondering , all in fifteen years to the guilty .
it was fat .
you thought about is , if you fat from the food , we , we 're all this suggests , and be healthy the old .
what the <unk> of <unk> <unk> shelves , with different <unk> in america in supermarkets , has led and what does n't touch it has changed , that the americans every year 's become aware .
then you have said , ah , no .
but not the fat .
it are the carbs .
now what to <unk> like the <unk> the <unk> , the <unk> and so has led .
it 's so , downloaded a new <unk> hurdle , it village <unk> .
where the whole <unk> ?
now , the reason is , for my taste , for the least , that we by <unk> <unk> approaches anecdotal isolated cases , to the science and wisdom <unk> .
example in for a <unk> alone is here .
the <unk> you know of all .

the top <unk> the <unk> <unk> for the next year .
keith richards , i was seven years for the number one actually nominated vice versa .
then , the newspaper .
or this lady here .
jean <unk> .
the oldest one person , the evidence shows ever attempted on the earth has lived .
<unk> years old .
i know , there 's some people , the people say , they are six , can but at their <unk> n't find .
jean <unk> is actually <unk> .
and they listened to <unk> on to smoke started , but with <unk> back to to then finally , <unk> <unk> the path of the great to follow and stop mobilizing to smoke .
with <unk> is then they died .
what that tell us ?
not that , cigarettes , healthy .
but it tells us that , aging , very complicated is , and that we -- what we need to an experimental media systems and we have an easy to ask me .
a very simple question , and a very simple issue , the in different countries , preserved , is women are older than men .
what is that ?
we know it 's now .
this is the testosterone into the <unk> so , in the male <unk> by 2027 .
and there 's <unk> very evidence for <unk> men are so just as old women .
you can now everybody , to itself , think , if that 's a <unk> <unk> is .
austria 's a free land .
but it are still better tips , not afraid .
we should we 've correlation was with this causality , to confuse this .
sounds complicated , but it 's easy to the usual <unk> to illustrate .
there 's visiting so somebody a <unk> grandma , and asks , what they have , because so different done or another way to eat , that you that old become are ?
ah .
that she has a day every decade of cigarettes , down .
that 's probably the secret of their ages , right ?


even being the statistics are not always meaningul .
there for a very hard to the , that shows that people , the <unk> in the <unk> go to grow to be as humans , the n't do this .
do .
this is that would reproduceably put them .
this is at the <unk> <unk> ?
no .
it 's because , that people just enough money in the pocket have to be wondering , well , to her age and the <unk> diseases to take care .
if i but a group of animals a <unk> to forage maybe give and this group with 20 percent to live longer than a group that the <unk> this is not get it has , but otherwise very much what i 'll show that i was then i actually probably a <unk> factor in the diet for affected .
and these are , these attempts been done .
to tell you , the <unk> is very bitterly at , but even i do with my enemies , agree am is , the twin said that live up .
and this works for the different organisms .
for example , bacteria .
you see here , ai <unk> of bacteria .
if we the fast , in the <unk> line showing then life that much longer .
and the same for <unk> , <unk> flying over mice and recently was only ago about two years in the united states has shown that , even for the monkey is true .
and it 's not , skinny .
it works , <unk> the <unk> kitchen .
and this is a another experiment , in the united states .
what did you did here ?
you have a <unk> and has the one that we <unk> given , a <unk> diet , where you so many <unk> this day and night get .
and who to wonder about it , the mice are being dick became , sick and have a very bad <unk> of out and bad <unk> .
now you have a parallel <unk> and that has the right into the same number of the <unk> looking at the only that moment a recess .
the have the day , not much food for further , for you have at twice as much eating .
and this <unk> now is this suggests , and healthy and they also has no <unk> .
despite having both animals <unk> feed itself .
both have to you ate too much .
the a sick and the other healthy .
so what happens in fact ?
it 's a process called cellular <unk> or <unk> on .
when you look , they were organisms , or stem cells start to take away then she catches the organism , redundant ingredients in the cell or degraded ecosystems do sort of mining to that spawned again , energy .
that makes sense .
and that looks like this .
you can see , in the cell , it . <unk> form of the junk , the during the ages <unk> .
the customers , then with the stomach that if there are <unk> and the cell as energy back to one .
it 'll leave you damage the age , accumulate in the limitations on .
this is about the molecular <unk> the <unk> , or the <unk> of the <unk> often tell .
so , to it so , twin said , they spread that live in different organisms .
and it 's probably , accepting that , who works .
and we learn from this is , they just not like in <unk> recommended , every little <unk> the day with two <unk> fight to .
no .
but , they should do to say , if you 're hungry , have , ah , maybe it just the <unk> on .
welcome you your hunger , as a boyfriend .
and this is also <unk> sense .
while <unk> had nine nine percent of human history has the person , what did , when he got hungry man had ?
alright , he 's go chase you go .
we go out regularly look at the fridge , hunting , if we 're hungry .
and that 's safe to the biology .
now we know , and that 's already in the bible , in <unk> chapter <unk> verse <unk> , the mind is : , but the meat is weak .
the garden , looks for us very different .

the three guys here 's good , the food , all day , let , also need to serve .
and that 's sort of the actual <unk> .
we 've so on the quest for all done , the molecular response of <unk> turn , despite the organism to eat .
and that could for people to be interesting , whose <unk> not enough just <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and it could we might have a the hardest <unk> of life to preserve .
the question is so that we can <unk> , the <unk> , the cellular <unk> turn , although you eat ?
and we have many hundreds , at the thousands of all scans , natural substances .
we have in the fact is a found that means <unk> .
<unk> is a solid substance , the in all of organisms that naturally does the but also in all of organisms that during the halt even less will .
in your skin , it 's the <unk> .
<unk> people have been much less <unk> in your skin as <unk> .
and if we now <unk> on human cells , there for example , then you see this .
this is a following the cell here .
is the <unk> , the nucleus , we give <unk> on and we see many thousands of these little <unk> in the cell of the junk , the during the ages <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> cells were very , just like this .
and this works in different organisms .
here for example , shown on a <unk> .
so we have a substance , they found that the molecular <unk> lightbulb the <unk> .
life , because the organisms that , no longer .
and the answer is again , you see here 's a typical <unk> of <unk> .
it are simple <unk> .
after <unk> days are the all dead , after that 's the days is about half the dead .
when you look , we <unk> the water , there , here in very colorful characters are the animals grow and surviving better .
we also know , that human cells , that we of <unk> ex vivo <unk> have in culture , about three times as long to survive , if we do you with <unk> put themselves .
and the latest research on , too close that even the lives of all over mice , <unk> they spread of .
and it 's not only that life , it 's also the <unk> .
these mice are really <unk> .
so .
now you want to say , all know , where is <unk> ago ?
how the name is already says , it 's the sperm being discovered was , you get it in very high concentrations .
but i can you we all , in <unk> fresh green and pepper mushrooms , cheese , and a product of <unk> <unk> , in japan , big <unk> afforded , that 's <unk> <unk> 's very much <unk> ago .
we 've then , if <unk> against <unk> helps , it the junk <unk> it then you may also , <unk> ?
they have to which is to know , the common point of all <unk> diseases is that during the ages <unk> in the brain <unk> .
and we have in the did experiments that made .
they 're going to wonder , we have the world to fruit flies .
flies to see , you a forgetful memory , if you old .
they have more <unk> in the brain , if you old .
and the molecular mechanisms , the for memory that are areas of these are very much like the people .
now you ask you try to yet , how to the devil has the fellow the memory of flies have measured it ?
this is the experiment , what we share with stephen , these seals out of college berlin who did .
you take a hundred flies and put that 's a there are one another example , they love .
<unk> .
and let the , in this <unk> <unk> .
then they take the same fly , give them in the chamber , and give you <unk> different smell , they love , which <unk> .
we let them the <unk> enjoy , but if you ai <unk> <unk> .
in classic <unk> .
then take them back into the same fly , do that here in .
the driving this degree in the elevator , down , there you that .
and if you down here , which are , give them from the one side <unk> and of other side <unk> this .
where you go into the all go ?
it .
to <unk> .
except the wonderful here .
these are the <unk> .
or , we say , they have a character .
i love my <unk> and i want , let me not by this ai <unk> going to corrupt .
okay .
but it 's a form of the character , to the age increases .
not only in fruit flies .
and we could actually the <unk> the fly through <unk> on a <unk> , on a <unk> , and back into .
and the <unk> , the brain that were , were back into some .
that is , <unk> does n't just to , and aging world , but to <unk> diseases , maybe .
and that 's important , because we want , the <unk> not the lifespan , per se extend .
it is no point , the time the <unk> to extend .
and i want you do n't let them , without you still , a few practical , tips , to do we 're that maybe some younger .
still time <unk> fast .
it 's not about , that you gained weight on or so .
there 's the way now in austria as a group of <unk> people , the one day you eat and one day n't eat .

and the , the very good pilot .
that is , it 's <unk> .
that they <unk> .
it 's not to carbs , complex , carbs , seem to do n't be dangerous . .
it 's really to take candy .
you know now , that <unk> burst out there are , to diabetes in their own , even then if you this suggests that .
and you know , that sugar the growth of tumors -- accelerate through .
here you ai <unk> , the ago , to all ages .
after 30 days are the all dead .
very low doses of glucose rich .
to a <unk> effect to create .
there 's just an example , that works in almost all of organisms that .
and eat them being the fruit and vegetables .
and avoid them the gift of to a lot <unk> or of <unk> all .
you know now that <unk> -- and <unk> cancer can now .
this is not under conditions for them vitamin d .
we are there might have degrees ' in the a <unk> , because vitamin d is driven by sunlight on the skin them .
some that you least three times per week , downloaded a half hour of sports , this is completely trivial .
and cigarettes , despite the obsession <unk> examples of them <unk> 10 to fifteen years lifetime .
do they engaging in times of the eternal <unk> occasionally the quiet .
the impact of praying , and blood pressure on the life expectancy is really notice .
because the monks of life , so long , how women .
<unk> , <unk> <unk> , live longer than <unk> .
<unk> live longer than <unk> .
but <unk> life and still no longer than <unk> .
just <unk> die , sooner than <unk> .
what is that ?
the people assume , that has to do with some really all business .
no way , no way , that 's easy .
if now here 's a <unk> the window is then a plaster ' i the with <unk> <unk> solution .
and what 's like that 's probably in her around .
<unk> them , <unk> and so what , going through to get under conditions there <unk> .
why has no alcohol , ai <unk> effect .
a permanent partner , or a family , longevity is associated with .
they should n't need to take a lot of the busiest streets you live .
now if you see the same <unk> .
that has surely , <unk> it 's nothing to do .
it goes to <unk> .
you can measure the closer to someone at a lot of the busiest streets in the type , the more <unk> , he has the blood .
and that 's , if he says , i was time you 're used .
i can already well to sleep and the noise , i do n't .
not true .
he has yet , more <unk> in the blood and that 's bad .
the sunlight and it could be because <unk> course .
we know now , that <unk> very good metabolic effects .
so , it that the <unk> down .
and we also know that onions and <unk> mice , you 're infectious to protect .
knew that way our grandmothers also have the us with <unk> and so <unk> .
it 's not without any sense .
several long-term studies , from , that dark chocolate , dementia <unk> work .
just recently is a study still , that has shown that , downloaded a half the board of dark chocolate , a day , the <unk> one <unk> on this level of <unk> can make .
the same sorts of what you of coffee is at the but it thinner .
there 's trials , the show , there 's trials , it does n't show .
what 's clear , is , coffee , diabetes <unk> it and their metabolic performance better .

a very nice and intricate study in the hundred thousand people have thought for where they were have shown that people , that every day a handful of nuts to eat their <unk> to 20 percent mortality down .
this is a huge value for a <unk> study .
and this is for almonds . <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
but not to peanuts all the <unk> seen in fact , beans .
the give just to transition , they nuts call , okay .
that are , but actually , beans .
so for the peanuts , is the not .
the next thing is a little bit dodgy .
and avoid them the tape of to a lot of animal protein , so of meat and dairy , but only , if you between <unk> and <unk> years old .
a very beautiful new study shows , that you , if you in this time to a lot of animal protein to try to take you <unk> so strong that , as if you a powerful our smokers , be .
this is not for the time after the animal protein that are good and it as of course not for <unk> children or a juvenile , the animal protein need and it is not for pregnant and people like , that 's going to .
we find that they <unk> .
what we also , they do , you staying <unk> know that , friedrich nietzsche along , the has said the important to say , the <unk> , that a happy or actually the <unk> are signs of health .
all <unk> heard in the pathology labs .
this is the gentleman <unk> <unk> the has about after this time , lived and he 's <unk> years old .
it out of my home <unk> from the <unk> , is never get sick .
and he 's very well .
he 's just not <unk> as not an anecdote , but he lives in a <unk> , where it 's one of healthy <unk> there .
he has about the <unk> followed , that i do you today i said .
we should look at all the <unk> way it ai n't important fact , not only overlook .
because , that <unk> of a halt aging , i 've not organic , but a social to be extremely , and so eventually a psychological .
you <unk> the old people less to and that could one of the <unk> wrong with our culture .
<unk> wrote the biggest novel at the <unk> a year ago , he died .
the brothers <unk> .
a piece , in contemporary of critics , the adolescents , fresh <unk> .
i thank you for listening .
i want to start with a question , that i 'm here .
a question , where now , no up to , because that 's a little <unk> because of you who 's really lonely ?
the output is , very low .
without even when i thought .
it has but probably the reasons , why do n't who have , the people that for , which is quite <unk> would .
many people confuse <unk> and loneliness and think that would <unk> .
this is not liking that the case .
you 'll see , and loneliness is actually more like a phenomenon of people than just straightforward .
maybe that 's it also , it to do n't who have , because the question here before .
like to be wondering , lonely , or is you very lonely ?
you can be wondering , lonely , feeling , without feeling lonely .
and you can be lonely be without the moment , lonely having to feel .
it’s loneliness and also has a lot to shame .
also that 's some now here from have , it loneliness to <unk> .
and loneliness is in the shame and realize is in loneliness .
and loneliness that takes time .
also is therefore , now here , nobody who have in the few seconds , that i put them have .
and loneliness to <unk> .
and loneliness to the time , to try to their own , even aware .
and loneliness to also practice , to talk about to discover .
and this exercise we actually have one time .
we have neither the language , we have any sign for ourselves to recognize when we are lonely process ?
there 's going to loneliness to two <unk> , which way , i faced am .
the one part of man says , you is from beginning to most lonely .
of the birth to death is you just really lonely .
there 's a few moments in life where you that <unk> .
these people go and often to <unk> and then we need to the whole day .
i ' danzón no time , is so you <unk> .
and then there 's people might be less country , the say , everything is with everything connected .
that i think there 's not actually , so , i 's just a piece of big universe .
and there 's the great group , to the i also one of the time , so , , so thinking .
the thinking , okay , today i am feeling lonely and the next day , oh , it , and it all together .
if we looked at , and loneliness to think of us , first of the very large and loneliness to a comet .
the loneliness of dying , the loneliness to the person on an icu .
but about this <unk> , about these large <unk> <unk> ' what i do n't talk , but i want to talk about the small , over the everyday <unk> , and loneliness to us , like a theater going to meet .
i also want to do n't talk about the burden , and <unk> of <unk> .
and loneliness to with others to think of us , not difficult and loneliness to with us to <unk> .
the photographer and christine , tailors , in the break a few pictures made , that i show you want .
how easy it 's always off , at the other and loneliness to discover .
and we all know , not , whether these people , really that moment , lonely , have felt .
but who knows it 's not , the moment , so <unk> event , where you think , all talking together , just to itself is something lost in the corner and has n't want to <unk> .
this sudden <unk> loneliness to know the safe here all .
may have some of you today , i 've seen .
what you about what you do that cell phone out very often , that could you today , very good at this is playing , that <unk> on the cellphone , an escape , the <unk> .
and visible , if you on the display , we look .
what we now here 's not do .
yeah , and then there 's the loneliness , the types , you sitting on the loneliness is one <unk> on <unk> stage , hundreds of <unk> faces in front and you even something out in the hope , that you to text , not forget .
these are the <unk> , that you the outside of see .
that we other people we ascribe them .
but i 'm sure , there 's also people in the room , the way . of birth to most lonely , feel that their entire life for so he spent have , they have tried , that it’s loneliness of the <unk> , to distract them .
and there 's in this room , guaranteed , people that are feeling lonely , because they 're on a different people with you must be it 's because of death or because of a separation .
there 's using it , nothing , that still so many people , people , where they 're connected to around them are you feel the lonely .
and there 's people , the have the relevant to be wondering , even lost , no contact with more to be wondering , and are so , one lonely .
i <unk> ' that the digital loneliness .
and sit down , you were the analog teaching and loneliness .
the analog teaching and loneliness is we 're familiar .
that are people who are going to her to what 's no . their social contact .
also that 's always had relative .
there 's not an official number , not an arbitrary number , whenever somebody coming to human contact , has , when i do n't .
we cut down there , the older people .
it 's the analog form of loneliness .
since we but everybody in cities where to a very many people at facebook or by reading twitter or facebook is this digital loneliness is always gets bigger .
you can with hundreds of people connected to be anything , with one of people really connected to be .
it 's at the analog loneliness to the quantity of human relationships , the missing is it at the digital and loneliness to the quality of relationships .
the two forms of loneliness to be very often do the <unk> .
this is also about , the analog teaching and loneliness to a mold traveling .
whereas the digital loneliness . good place for <unk> and columns in <unk> .
it 's this point that the digital loneliness and in the future , you gain is when the possibilities , to connect to be bigger .
i do n't know , if you in 20 years that feeling that the our from loneliness is very similar to be that , more loneliness to call it .
or whether you for and then a new word that there .
but that are also kind of problems in the successional generation .
almost more than the loneliness to itself is the fear in front of loneliness and from this fear in front of loneliness that are people can say to do n't ready .
<unk> , the big <unk> , as a <unk> person has a wonderful <unk> written <unk> .
in the story of them , what people do everything , to do n't alone .
they build cathedrals , they have kids , the then again , are feeling lonely and alone .
but that <unk> has n't you went to the fear in front of loneliness to kick out , which is to spend money .
and shop .
that 's favor .
both the process over , the loneliness , because it at least in short run a contact -- now , the objects themselves , that you are acquired by .
only problem is that 's very quickly led to help me and holding , this kind of those potions for the loneliness .
so we have , new things to buy us to <unk> .
i ' time the ad for a a <unk> panties label .
and the <unk> very very alert . <unk> of your communications , which be doing all of it .
what this at jumping has to do , you know you do n't , but apparently you can also that .
and loneliness . so nothing to the <unk> to do loneliness to figure out of people that instead .

hand on it 's heart , who knows that 's not ?
in a relationship to wake up or the or the other the brushing to see and wondering , suddenly , terrible period , to feel , terrible lonely having to feel and the question to ask , who is this man 's really ?
i ' i have , even something to do ?
a study of saying that , the most lonely and women to the its , married , with kids , feel .
this missing , because i 'd already . know , if i the study , even invented , to have so often . i ' i they told .
but now is also totally unlike matter because it at least in studies , whatever is , and the reaction , right is that people , i <unk> .
that intuitive , so completely obvious thing is , almost have a <unk> .

talk , that little bit about the loneliness to the sex .
this is also has 've probably everybody has experienced .
still as you <unk> is , suddenly appeared to think , what do 'official ' i think is really ?
who is this person in my bed , really ?
this is also a form of loneliness that 's not what to have to the quality of sexual 's .
also have nothing to do have to the quality of commitment .
they just is always there .
we speak only do n't about them , because we do n't you look at .
we speak only , right to do n't about them in the workforce .
in the workforce is the loneliness is also <unk> than we think .
i stood <unk> on that <unk> <unk> and i 've been watching a group of five <unk> , , i should be three of them suit and two of them costume either .
the two men have to talk , the two women in a costume designers have to talk .
and in between what was something <unk> , something <unk> with the <unk> in the hand of an intern .
i think , i have to you the scene do n't turn out on with them that form of loneliness that everybody 's also have time in his the fabric has experienced , again <unk> .
it 's the loneliness of <unk> .
but it 's also the loneliness of <unk> .
we all know the <unk> or i see , in this may also some of their lives of dexterity . <unk> .
in <unk> , in <unk> in the hotels , is interchangeable , bars that often do n't know more , who they 're actually , what they do .
where they are , where you wake up .
also that 's a form of loneliness , over the not talking of .
just so it 's also <unk> , and loneliness than <unk> to misuse .
down here is insulation .
i have , a <unk> told , that he 'd been from a client , and the has said , it 's what 's very , then happened , you can do it you did n't imagine .
a <unk> was alone in the lunchroom .
so he has to itself to <unk> up .
and two months later , he 's also have stepped down .
the loneliness is n't alone so .
they come , in touch with other feelings .
they have a beautiful siblings and they have ugly siblings .
the ugly siblings , we know all .
fear , of your desperation , anger and the shame .
but we should also the beautiful 's not forget .
the freedom of the proud of the desire that <unk> .
so my plea for you look at your mind . loneliness .
and come and goes in life as the tide , and floods occur .
let them to and let do n't of her up .
because there 's still a much worse than the loneliness and this is the emptiness that perhaps , sort of loneliness is if you do n't even more to track them .
and loneliness is part of life .
since i do this intensity of loneliness is i think i have to start to me two things change .
for one in my circle the <unk> i 'm not even more like a disagreement dictator since i realized i did that i only then always somebody who 'd have why him to do n't raise because i thought i may be recording i the people , maybe i 'm going ' i lonely .
i think about it 's been able , since i the loneliness and in my life it until you have more people come and go to them .
so just about the acquaintances , that you that power .
also because i can become .
people come and go to make it , they 're not anymore , to who , whether , from an encounter a friendship , or even a partnership to do .
as a child i found my parents bought an embarrassing .
that can look at any <unk> by , without working with somebody a conversation with anybody .
whether in the <unk> or in the economy .
every time led it to an average .
as a child i found that as i 'm embarrassed .
as young adult , i was they just looking for <unk> that being able to this openness .
but first since i even so with the loneliness to work with you have , that 's me at least , and go back to me also direct acquaintances , like to open .
you see it 's really lonely be called , are willing to the performance .
thank you .
yes , thank you .
i 've got madd '' here , i seem that .
a <unk> a <unk> and a <unk> .
and now that , i do you if you just once into i 'm sure what they drew you would take ?
the most people would be wondering , for the <unk> decide .
and that 's a damn good idea .
and why ?
because we do with the least of effort into the largest negative effect : how do .
in health , we doing this kind of different .
because we let the activity with the biggest impact at all other than eight and make us to have different strategy .
we choose to us for example for the <unk> and the is for sports .
big <unk> but big effort .
for me why not so valuable .
or we choose to us for the <unk> .
the is for food .
also very large <unk> but still very big effort .
for me so , not so valuable .
and i want you today about how they do with the least of effort into the biggest <unk> outcomes .
if you to prevention and health , too , which is how you to a subject does n't figure around .
and this is overweight .
and this topic either overweight , was in germany , long time , no issue , so roughly equivalent to in the <unk> .
and then joined the number of obese people in germany and strong .
and i asked me , what was there on in the <unk> ?
why was that soar , suddenly , ?
and then i research and i 'm also <unk> .
because it was exactly the years <unk> .
what was there ?
there was <unk> to germany .
and we 're going over and along ?
and i was going on .
<unk> comes or to germany .
and that obesity is increasing .
and the years <unk> take the curve . it 's , right at the journey on .
and what then it comes to germany ?
<unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , and how all this means .
and we 're going over and along ?
well , i was one , and one was cleared .
because it was , right .
exercise power .
and of stuck , i 'm not here today , to say , that the sport , thick .
because that 's not true .
but one , we 've now , and found .
the tide of always a training -- and <unk> has n't notice that led , that we are thinner and healthier .
what it 's so then ?
the atkins diet ?
and also there 's a very good study from the united states .
also the have the problem with obesity .
and they have in the <unk> <unk> introduced .
and then they wanted to each and look , what 's really ?
and they 've seen , the people take in fact , less fat , but the people take it also , fewer calories in going to , but nevertheless , along .
and that was the paradox .
and so you have it <unk> .
we can this for us ?
there must do the body as a power to imagine .
because we have here as a big <unk> .
and the one side of it 's a <unk> , because i do we all the coals on , the be here is burned .
and this is the energy <unk> when electricity .
if we now , but more the coals on here in to give in our power than we need to the other side of <unk> , the energy in the power and it took off .
the human body does n't just get off .
the can get the energy to store .
and it in terms of fat .
our greatest and <unk> <unk> .
what happens , but if we are fewer such as we 've heard , energy <unk> and yet <unk> , there 's the energy and then it 's only one thing .
the <unk> has to drastically reduced .
there , no life , more than .
we are , only still up .
and this is this happens .
our grandparents are <unk> still two miles to a fluke .
and we come today , once in a to two miles and are the positive and do it .
there 's trials , the report of five -- until <unk> feet .
i <unk> , you the other thing . <unk> with my friend mike , telling .
give you my degrees ' the chair ?
mike , if you degrees ' time ?
mike 's americans .
he 's really shy , he will not talk too much .
and he was back at this trial and sitting now here .
he 's this typical southerners <unk> , for me to <unk> <unk> and he has a <unk> in the hand .
and mike , eats , less and still less and takes only still <unk> , and yet it 's over and along .
why ?
because that mike wallace 's only still sitting .
and i was time i watched , how much more movement that mike , so the day , and i told him , so one step counter , the bag will put them and the night i went back <unk> .
and there stood on a thousand steps .
this was so the distance , that mike , at has the morning , from the kitchen to the car with the car into the office there , of course of a coffee out , and in the back .
and he came on a thousand steps .
that means that mike was at this day , 10 minutes on its legs .
<unk> hours and fifty minutes i was mike , or whatever was mike .
under those conditions of disease of us alone .
and mike 's not why did dick , because it to be much eating chips because long as it up , energy <unk> this , but not used , he will inevitably , along and the energy <unk> .
and the first <unk> , the energy , you can see here at his <unk> .
but energy is <unk> , that is not there .
the <unk> , eventually got back in <unk> blood .
and also there is they were active and <unk> still , and quiet on his <unk> .
so the blood sugar .
so if we have to the energy <unk> the blood , you 're talking about the physicians of high blood and high <unk> .
and this blood sugar , the <unk> 's like <unk> , does all little black holes in this <unk> .
and a lucky , floating if there are still at the big fat around and that 's placed . now about these little nasty wounds and we speak of <unk> or <unk> .
and now comes <unk> heart right under pressure , because now he has to the blood flowed through these tight <unk> our heat pumps and we talk from high .
and if this high , like a <unk> true , it 's also in the body -- her .
and if that the heart was happening , then we call the heart attack .
and if that in mind has happened then we call the stroke .
and also in germany and dies every second . their heart and the stroke .
that is , in germany and dies every second item . <unk> .
and also mike 's so not so sick , because he does n't like sports is driving , but because it , does n't even more than moving .
and if you this across n't know , for you always on in the wrong .
for the theme of diet .
i have degrees ' was still , caloric-restriction diet , amazon went into and get there environment , <unk> <unk> <unk> , now .
and if each book , just like a centimeter is thick and we were the here <unk> , we have a 30 feet high tower , the current <unk> <unk> .
and i was the time for you read all .
and there 's inside and now this is really important if you more energy goes in so more food as they consume and then you be thick .
and if you less energy that when they consume and then you be thin .
that 's brilliant .
but why we need to the environment , you ?
that 's only one thing .
the need is obviously this huge , but <unk> is to do n't help .
because it fails of a diet , to a hundred percent ?
because it 's a diet is , and not a lifestyle .
what do the things , that we here , three weeks to make and here , five weeks , if we then , after this struggle , again in the normal life back , to our ordinary life around .
what we then , after five or seven weeks ago ?
nothing .

so for further . ab now at any new diet , at any new <unk> ask you can and you want that in their day-to-day , in your lifestyle to integrate .
yes or no ?
and when i mean , then go .
and if no , you make it just stay .
because if the end n't get out , it 's brain in time .
it are the habits that this , they decide whether we 're sick to or stay healthy .
it are the bad habits , that we get sick .
and it are the good behavior that tells us healthy .
and if mike , in the mirror at then he look and the result of everyday lifestyle .
if mike , in the mirror and you look , then he look and his daily habits .
and if mike , in the mirror and you look , and to be wondering , is , then he look , where it 's the way .
because when he 's more bad habits , as good , then it 's just in towards the way .
and if mike , in the way to the direction , you are moving its goals , moving its dreams , then he has to do n't immediately be whole life change .
then he need to just more good behavior as bad .
and a <unk> habits and mike 's also a great example of the person has been a weird animal is .
mike 's for example , did , moving out completely his life <unk> by it every way to the car , of an escalator , using , every elevator that would use .
and night is he <unk> on the couch and to somehow tying back at the movement .
so is he , in his <unk> goes into the gym . there with the escalator , what yes , per se , this is , and will then how it ai n't going back on this is a band bring out , so he got back at the movement .
and my grandpa did that , just so amusing , as you .
the was a farmer and the have that did n't understand .
the have said , sport is for people that we have to do n't move .
and somehow he has also pretty much .
why we have at night in our very precious and play , that effectively compensate for what we the ground forgot to have ?
i must be taken , we have today at this <unk> lifestyles after two hours of sports can make a day .
and about , but very much easier to the back there to find where we do you have lost .
the ground .
and so <unk> ' i do you today to a perspective invite you .
maybe even know , they also the situation , you drive the evening . it was time , shopping to and in good , does that in the front row — no way for free .
and that you look like , so i sort of <unk> in us .
we 're always the shortest because they go .
we plan our homes and so that we <unk> have a way .
we plan our whole life true that we the <unk> have a way , but that leads us , but not going , where we <unk> .
but in a very different direction .
so to them . ab now the <unk> activate and the back there are finding , where they 've been seen .
i check , like to participate in the track .
and i 'm the only , the always waking up and down and up and down there 's now , and everybody else .
but if i mean , already passed , because i 'm then <unk> ' i mean , the time for me .
then <unk> ' i mean , the movement is a , that 's just like around the ways .
and if of up the <unk> coming , 30 minutes repository , say , i hooray .
environment , steps .
that are about three times 10 minutes of translation .
and a <unk> environment , if you go from here today , every day environment , steps more , then that mean , you to the day , twelve pound of fat , not in your body record .
this may be relatively little sound .
but when <unk> , as a habit of saying , time <unk> days , then we talk from four point five pounds of fat .
that we 're not in our bodies .
and you give me degrees ' time that , i <unk> , it always <unk> .
the americans are , crazy , the put something so here .
this is a <unk> of five pounds of fat .
are , get ' i four pounds .
just so you , you see , what 's going to those little baby steps .
and if that the effect is coming from this perspective , what you mean , what happened just happened , if you really in an active life up .
and this <unk> the bring them . ab now , every day in their day-to-day .
once you at <unk> steps per day , which are , walk you virtually everybody 's prevalent it .
and if you feel like , and i have time in sports and then they doing this on top .
then you have to the <unk> also still <unk> .
then you will also , even faster and stronger .
but do with them to your health . on the amount of sports .
so they make your health . on the amount of like it , and of their time .
because the most important , the that they doing now , every day as much .
and i <unk> ' one of active life around <unk> .
and to me is it has gotten more than a lifestyle , for me , it 's a <unk> that on a clear that decision based on for the lives and for me .
because i think , health has not to do with , what we should do , or have to do .
but health has to do with , what we want to do .
and so <unk> ' i now only still an idea for them .
you decide . ab now just still for the greatness .
and ab now you can also how it goes .
step to step .
thank you .
<unk> how it has a leonardo , da vinci , actually done on this incredible , you see , kind and in the world with others ' eyes to see ?
and to itself as far on that engage , what to his time , just simply inconceivable , never thought was ?
we could have that also now ?
this might do with companies to do ?
and how we can turn into force and the process , for our future to draw ?
we start , there are on with the question what we understand it 's out of innovation ?
it .
technology of research and development , even the official <unk> the federal government has the title <unk> the federal government .
so you know about me , right .
this is yes , all great .
and we can with quite proud to be and be grateful that we <unk> in such a lot of the fields are that our technologies around the world to be that it gives us well with it goes .
that we do with a so extraordinary , unique prosperity that have .
but what it with the future from ?
the challenges , because when society based on us to ?
and who cares , because there to the large environmental and social engineering challenges ?
so <unk> , it seemed kind of fine .
a kind of labor .
so the economy they said , to the environmental challenges , because the entrepreneurs and then the big effort , we then the productivity and efficiency up .
and that the world better to do the find yourself to in the nonprofit organization and bring together and citizens ' and the need to actually , what companies , so if you 're entrepreneurs of course , to then the damage the inner capitalist in the economy to remove themselves .
at least , very complex to fix .
but who says , because that we all this as it has been separated at have ?
how about it because if we <unk> to a social and cultural dimension , you ?
if technological innovation in the same as cultural innovation are ?
if of innovations together , as social innovation are ?
if it gives us capable leaders , thinking and doing to self-assemble with the solution of environmental and social engineering challenges ?
if it very different kind of knowledge of forces <unk> and if it 's even a very different , and fair <unk> this great cost ?
because it was that ?
both sides to have , but what companies , right ?
can we do it ?
ask you may come .
now we have that yes , as a way .
fortunately , there 's encouraging examples .
muhammad yunus , with his <unk> , with his <unk> in bangladesh , an awful lot of linking up to the poverty , there <unk> .
and interestingly , too much more now in direct <unk> to the , what the government <unk> done .
and he has <unk> as entrepreneurs , i realized that the nobel <unk> get .
at the opportunity because of me a i <unk> ' they still with anyone familiar to do .
from now , can i think <unk> <unk> .
'n . <unk> young guy .
you are trained , has , but also its ideal from capsizing .
and yes , so totally <unk> .
i love the really like .
and if you the see , then you think it 's really , at the offspring , because we need to us to our future , n't worry .
yes , right after the very strongly that has he then there 's begun to work in our <unk> <unk> <unk> .
that does he also very good .
that they like him , and she 's also very successful .
and yet , something is there 's still so in him .
so he asks , there 's not be more , that somehow , i would be there ?
so that this entrepreneurial , he says , then always .
companies are , in all <unk> .
and that they like him .
and he had fallen as these <unk> .
so the right there 's also the <unk> , the did he is just get detected .
so not that he asked him for you know , but it comes from <unk> tells him the future , what .
and there was in the middle , at the t , three n , i knew he did n't .
so , the more he was surprised when the and then the <unk> personally was introduced .
when mister <unk> .
and as 'n an entrepreneur , he has , then there are introduced .
the 's great pleasure over years , so with young people together , and he presents his experience of science .
and the two , then you know each other .
and have to always made more met .
how about it because if we now , so in a lot of these conversations from the two times <unk> ?
yes , mister <unk> , so what was that because again , right .
what 's right now the difference between <unk> between <unk> <unk> and <unk> by business ?
that i still not so it allows you understood .
yes , so , <unk> then we start , at at the question what 's 'n <unk> company ?
so the name says , yeah .
the established markets , established products , established business customers , established structures , there 's a history .
and you can also quite sure exactly the quest . ab : there , where the big one is causing the .
and , ai ai <unk> , the very neat is can it also .
what 's because then we are actually a <unk> ?
so , <unk> , you <unk> been so one is it 's , n't guarantee it is not the small copy of a big company .
it 's something very different .
it has , a radically different character .
because it has you know nothing <unk> .
not by customer , no <unk> <unk> , nothing is known .
of that 's a <unk> a an organization that the purpose is a business to find yourself , to find , to develop the impact of this is , that , but all , would reproduceably put it 's and wondering , then we scale it .
and you 're certainly understand that , of course , so <unk> organization , very different very different ways of thinking there , very different <unk> , very different ways .
yes , that 's me , right .
but after what we look for because it ?
so , i <unk> ' time to then it away , because you can and <unk> <unk> to make money or ?
so i ' there , degrees , that fits very well , so 'n seminar i found in berlin who would you me that recommendation system ?
that means <unk> .
how you your business as well , <unk> and after the <unk> your life for <unk> did .
oh no .
so <unk> ?
what you think , because if you with the beginning , 30 your <unk> money in precisely what 's because after your <unk> ?
so we start you just a career as passive <unk> or what ?
what if you with your commitment , as i know you ?
and we look , the <unk> .
so the statistics about <unk> give you do n't <unk> perspective , because seventy percent of <unk> are very few years , then in a much worse , financial situation ago when your great .
money is always the result of a successful company , and one , it enterprise .
now , you money is an energy source for an enterprise actions .
and it is the foundation all economic <unk> .
but it 's never the goal of a company .
yes , which is then the goal ?
of the company ?
so , i guess what they do 'official ' i ' yet we learned , so without the goal is no way the right .
and so , we really have yet , then and measurable in time may be and so forth .
and when i all that 's not . i , so that as i can for something of , i do n't know what i 'm supposed to ?
so that i do n't feel good .
so how do i , because we decide , and risks in this feels , for me all that you know , and inherently uncertain .
yes , <unk> welcome the enterprise .
but i ' there might do for you .
one thread .
so the is yes , <unk> , so almost never been a secret .
and on the <unk> of generation to generation <unk> .
a <unk> for <unk> .
so , or how does tell you today ?
<unk> think , i , <unk> ?
so we tell you know , <unk> this .
at when the crises and <unk> and <unk> of uncertainty .
so does no guarantee empathy .
i think , i can you to one of contexts .
okay .
yes , thanks , mister <unk> .
but there are , just ask you put more .
that can you the same time i remember one of the important an enterprise qualities , is good question is to start .
we can the time one after the other through , that i may be better understand ?
so the first is what i am here and what i want this happen ?
yes , <unk> , there 's <unk> what moves you that about you move beyond , that 's bigger than you yourself ?
what <unk> you the world ?
what have the people of them , if you with you work ?
what you are willing to do ?
what are your inner , perhaps , yes , unconscious <unk> ?
why is that important , that to see ?
because that are also your business enterprise <unk> .
and how we do this of them ?
if you a ship to do to then <unk> not the men together parts of a hot , you to wood to collect , but i teach them , yearning for the discussion , an ocean .
yeah , .
so then i look , i told me the next questions .
what 's my <unk> <unk> ?
what is that ?
yes , <unk> now you can do your goal really time i could color .
actually could color in detail , colorful , but i <unk> , you 'll have a if you <unk> , what you do n't want to then it 's going to you 're staying .
you know , the story with the pink and elephants ?
it 'll tell me , there is a .
not ?
<unk> .
so , some time on .
reset your time , no turning pink and elephants .
okay ?
it does it , right ?
so no turning pink and elephants .
understand ?
no turning pink and elephants .
you see ?
so let 's us , if we were so on it 's focus on this , what we do n't want .
what 's actually the only way ?
because it <unk> ?
yes , right , displace it , you that , what you want .
so <unk> <unk> or maybe the baby pandas on the <unk> .
but we displace it 's not to visualize .
the way , what i just let me , you like , <unk> right ?
i ' there 's a brought .
look over time , if you <unk> .
<unk> <unk> in this war room <unk> lord smith .
and who ?
the at <unk> of three <unk> this <unk> what <unk> <unk> to death with a <unk> <unk> .
i <unk> <unk> of you to <unk> me your <unk> at <unk> the time sill sill <unk> <unk> place .
i <unk> the glass in the master <unk> .
i of what <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , sir .
and i of what <unk> my <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> 24-year-old lady , smith .
oh , but you ♫ but <unk> <unk> you <unk> ?

<unk> ago . <unk> .
it 's just a <unk> of <unk> .
the real <unk> is <unk> <unk> <unk> you ?
and <unk> what 's from ?
you what i noticed ?
has to something changed ?
okay .
okay , and the flower .
okay .
so , then we can look , then we can look , where the bear with that 's .
and action .
<unk> <unk> in this war room <unk> lord smith .
and who ?
the at <unk> of three <unk> this <unk> what <unk> <unk> to death with a <unk> <unk> .
i <unk> <unk> of you to <unk> me your <unk> at <unk> the time sill sill <unk> place .
i <unk> the glass in the master <unk> .
i of what <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , sir .
and i of what <unk> my <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> 24-year-old lady , smith .
and <unk> , it away from you that ?
so , i still , i was also be shocked .
i was really shocked .
when i was the first time i 've got back .
i thought it ca : yes , probably not was eradicated .
and still much more shocking , i was as me through the head off to is it might be that i actually the sort of this way through the area over ?
by my life .
and okay , i mean , this is yes , meaning .
to wake up there , the immediate <unk> to prevent that we spend most of our perception and our <unk> first <unk> .
but what 's because now , to ?
what <unk> ' i was and what <unk> ' i from ?
and so <unk> , among you your perception , lined up anywhere <unk> able to change , is a more important entrepreneurial quality .
well , thanks , then we get , the next question .
how could i really have to my get where ?
so , i find that a good question .
that that , i went in which every time , and i know that somehow not going forward .
yes , <unk> , there 's a good news for you .
that you get lighter and fall when you may have known as you have .
because if you your care of what 's clear , your inner drive and if you 'n in fact is very rough metaphor to have i promise you , is it inside of happen by .
almost automatically .
you 're going to do n't help you can than that a brainstorming , you 're headed , that stuff on you happen .
that are then these famous <unk> , that you get up under the shower , did .
and still a question i recommend you , to show you a good to , who you have them could who you to take an important questions could talk to there more input , more at with home to get .
and you 've also a model .
the <unk> have the great want .

for lunch at the famous big table .
and it 's totally different people .
so scientists , <unk> , politicians , a banker , as engineers , architects and he has a very intense <unk> clean .
but not in our world today , and so , where it to figure out went , who 's going to start by ?
who has been right ?
but rather to that suddenly become of these different <unk> things that are the so on no way , and it just one of himself had to come up .
well , the next question is what 's next step i do ?
<unk> there are doing . 's successful entrepreneur in the reason .
instead , to develop and management and so what they always just in the next step .
because what would you because in terms of uncertainty and also do ?
but the lead this very determined and with all the consequence out .
and if it 's and then there was well , dan , for you know , <unk> one step .
and even if the big , colorful <unk> <unk> nothing was then there 's and you know , downloaded a different .
so it 's important that you your what 's clear .
that there you the inside of security .
and the way , how we actually have all going to learn ?
although we that yes n't know , and it , nobody has said ?
-- and says , also <unk> at birmingham children .
so , this playful attempt to learn , this and cultivate this <unk> playful attempt for it 's also , this is gee-whiz fun thing that in a company is happening in a <unk> .
and that 's also just sort of this <unk> against the uncertainty , the us who would always been so anxious .
yes , thanks ! mister <unk> .
so that sounds like , yes , very good .
but i 'm not so , at me in the company , i think , there must be wondering , still a lot of bosses change that 's something happened .
and the reasons , here in germany , there 's always like this gives the mood .
and i think , there have the politicians to find out to worry that we have to change .
okay my boy , come with .
how do this time , down the water .
what you think , many people can you change ?
10 ?
thousand ?
ten million ?
look at this down .
if you see ?
alright , the .
this is the you change can , you really change can .
or to it , mahatma gandhi to say , for the change , that you in the world , looking in your own .
you think , beautiful words and huge role models , but how would that because it work ?
because we have , still 'n few <unk> on our <unk> .
helpful in all <unk> of crises , or if you to small , you feel for something or if you a famished firing squad and you all have to you to do .
and if you fall in these situations , wondering what you see you now despite all that , you , which is what you take you can physically came to give you very powerful to feel .
that , you , , what you to them like , over the you 're <unk> .
and very finally , that , you , what you actually sort of this crisis , or the , what happened is because i did .
so i mean , if you 're you already happening is , wondering , it at least worth it .
yeah well .
mister <unk> thank you .
and you think really , me that helps in my enterprise way ?
yes , right .
and among you do so , two things .
first time to the expression on the clarity of your inner <unk> , that then to your enterprise what will .
because that determines your perception .
and to the second one on your inner attitude to myself to .
because it <unk> you like the other people , to you behave .
the future is always just then when we our own change perceptions .
<unk> you that to ?
yes , i think , already .
thanks ! mister <unk> well then .
all good <unk> <unk> .
yes .
what you think of our <unk> ?
nice .
really , or , <unk> ?
and how we hold it because now , with this <unk> ?
this is a new <unk> ?
i mean , yeah .
very clearly .
which i do so , the spirit can see .
<unk> means then breathe stir up .
and this is , what the <unk> really is like .
a <unk> from those potions for the euphoria .
and no , so new <unk> , <unk> .
that the <unk> .
the right now this country to have in the big , the name <unk> .
from robert , bosch , about <unk> <unk> <unk> zeppelin -- or <unk> or how they all these hot .
let us , just that spirit to revivify it .
and who knows , maybe it , from our <unk> the leonardo in our time .
you see , i 'm <unk> .
maybe it would be so intuitive to , that i with kids , and their future i 'm concerned , because finally , yes , and the future .
instead is that the view , i of the time i enjoy .
i spend a lot of my life in prison .
four years ago , have my father and i do this program <unk> , entrepreneurship , for prisoners , i 've started .
we could qualify <unk> entrepreneurial , that means you can be wondering , after the prison , either on making or find after their i was lighter one the workplace , they actually , can hold .
why of time i was doing it does anybody to <unk> , so ones that are already have are the big mistake i 've done ?
our program is much not so easy to see how programs that , to kids do .
and frankly , i had said , i thought , that the <unk> the last place in the universe is . i work would .
do you know , is the most critical lack of a factor in the up with the people with that we work ?
we 've learned , it are positive models as a lot of men 's positive models .
and if you think about , why it in certain <unk> so many <unk> and so many <unk> there are often it 's because it on the father had no sensible work has that he -- my father , that he drugs which is , or that he asked ourselves in prison is .
and if then a seven-year-old child think about what it from his life to make it has may not even better idea , as a different lives might look , because he was n't even better models .
and he <unk> his father .
i <unk> , you , martin , imagine .

his father was an alcoholic drink and made the entire family life of that the hell .
when he was 12 , it 's his mother died , and he and be a little baby brother he had the home .
and it was the <unk> the great .
he was shy and <unk> and the perfect victims .
to the day as being a little baby brother , at a game , so roughly <unk> been is that the bottom are stuck .
there out , martin examines the first time the <unk> , he went on the enemy , and proposed to .
and from this day he was respect .
and it went off .
violence was part of now to his life , just like at his father .
how it goes well at the ones , that i just described . i , on ?
after the whole childhood , the youth who are lots of unemployed or have <unk> .
you 're not much different than your illegal activities and their <unk> <unk> .
and then they are no one day with people in jail is closed organizations that 's like that goes , their mind to the same thing around the also not a better models are .
about what , you think , think these people together , if you put together in prison are ?
mostly about not much good .
and they 're going to criminal justice in <unk> .
they sell and these drugs on a higher level , and we 're still in the prison where you to the prison <unk> could .
and that then in germany to <unk> of <unk> percent .
that is , in germany will get everybody had second criminals to prison .
then there 's but also people in prison , the , really change want .
but also these people wear a rubber stamps in the broad forehead .
and there 's <unk> .
and everywhere , where they come , is that your first building identity .
if you try to a work for , if you try to an apartment for whether they new they build a relationship to all you going to have this identity , with that rubber stamps as being , the you one who in the society that infinite , hard power .
this is the problem , in the we are .
how we try , this problem to solve ?
what they have this , you think , and many <unk> with ?
they will be surprised .
it are more entrepreneurial skills .
if you get a <unk> up who has definitely no idea of <unk> , of <unk> and of <unk> .
the only the subject <unk> has a 's a little <unk> , otherwise something , he 's not in the landed .
these characteristics we want to a good use .
we start our program with a <unk> education in prison , in three , where .
we get all of the basics of entrepreneurship and the economy .
everybody in order to write its own <unk> and everybody could take on a comprehensive <unk> part .
and then with we the people , after the custody at the <unk> , the <unk> at the strengthening of your personal relations and also at one of <unk> .
what for the founding , because of our program from a common ?
it 's a big , bandwidth , from <unk> to the agency for <unk> .
we have a <unk> and <unk> .

<unk> leaders , talent and his illusion of fast enough money to have him , very early to trade with their seduces us .
he had always been fun , it 's business to the idea .
he 's then <unk> the first time getting arrested .
and that into custody . it 's not very impressed me .
it took the opposite .
he says , i have today , he have at its second later prepared .
<unk> is he then the second time been wrongfully convicted .
and he was then only in therapy , part and then the <unk> .
and i learned it , he used to become leaders , talent for something <unk> can use .
he 's in september 13 had been , has then october <unk> its energy agency for <unk> started .
the agency 's well , he can now of life .
he has to very good <unk> of the design .
he 's now here with me .
if you get him to know each other to talk about it .
still time back to martin , that i told him to start telling .
martin , has to his childhood a training for us earlier , and ended up in his time in the <unk> <unk> .
and because alcohol , and they go up there at the agenda are was his circle of fairly quickly started .
he worked with a dj , and as <unk> .
twenty years , which he took this life .
and he says , today , that he did with this fabulous lifestyle to do n't own consciousness <unk> .
one day that he got someone at a <unk> so hard that he then the world .
he took the <unk> part and that <unk> there has really his life changed .
he learned , and it to more force to more successfully and to more life index coming to life without his <unk> to do or without drugs to consume .
and he was of its current knowledge , so excited that he had decided that i want it would pass .
and he wanted to become part of <unk> .
that has really work .
he works for now starting about two years at us and <unk> our participants in their way in the freedom , because he knows , ourselves that , if you really change to , and if you have the right tools to look at the hand , that much more possible is when you 're oftentimes i want .
the basis of these successes are the way people as you .
people , the with us to jail , the to of sessions with us to come to our participants in their <unk> , in your personal plans to get you .
that are our authority , the <unk> talks in our class , i think , that are students at the <unk> do , <unk> the begin to do .
and that are we 've met , the our participants , right after the prison with .
and also these people take a very much of our program with .
one example .
we do it 's in events , an exercise , the way . <unk> called .
we 're pasting , then in the middle of space a big so on our participants are the one and our an stand on the other side .
and i 'm then of questions .
and every time , if anyone in space that question , `` yes answer is he looked at the line .
and here shows , what we all have that , whether we 're inside of jail agreed to sit or outside .
but also , where the differences are .
and an example of this , where the differences are , is following question .
i 'm in whats called the social focal point up , i had a family member of what we 've even in custody .
there are usually very many of our participants in the line , a very few days of an environment .
a question , that i 'd like taking place , the us all together , the <unk> ' i 'd like you imagine .
and i urge you that they all , up .
maybe we can be a little light , in the audience .
i can you see .
it are all .
well .
thank you .
i get , you now a question , and if you that question , yes , you 're trying to do again , otherwise would remain they just stand .
this is sort of our our line , that we now .
i have in my life of things done , for the i have held accountable to be able to it was , but not .
if you that question , yes , you 're trying to do they go .
that counts , drunk all the risks .
that counts , maybe as low doses of marijuana or obsessed .
that counts , the seat , not very , just taken .
okay .
and it 's also to , maybe any workforce , not always very correctly for cancer .
all right .
the most of your seats .
we have a couple of the angel in space .
that 's wonderful , because i 'm happy .
thank you , they 're allowed to all back down .
at this question , if that we went on the events , imagine , get our an environment very often the mulling stage .
and you will also clear , how much broader happiness , you may have had .
happiness with the parents , happiness with the environment , in the they were growing up , with the friends , but also very lucky , that you may not always been with being caught by these are if you something that 's by the <unk> or as well beyond this did .
what are the results of our work ?
sixties percent of our alumni , from within <unk> days after their i was a work .
this is very quickly .
<unk> percent have to start already on the time .
a third of the donors are in the last year we were <unk> .
and our <unk> is at seven percent .
i did it already told the <unk> of seven percent is a <unk> in germany of <unk> percent of us to .
i 'm <unk> .
a <unk> costs in <unk> per year , taxpayers <unk> dollars .
and it 's a <unk> , calculating what a <unk> of seven percent of us to a <unk> of typically <unk> percent for a massive saving local means .
when my father and i do that <unk> started to have , we 're quite frankly , the first group of pretty much for quite nuts and that .
i was my great <unk> in a big businesses comes up .
but i must tell you , i in my life is still not as a <unk> work done .
we encourage our participants this , responsibility to take .
responsibility , in your life 's happened and so , responsibility for to adopt , in their lives will happen .
now , not to hide , nothing to whitewash .
because that leads to a very new consumer confidence and what it 's also , again , faith to build .
and so it makes me very happy and pride , if our participants , of their way to report .
now i you a video with them .
film .
so i was convicted to two years , and eight months , because of a dangerous <unk> .
i was because <unk> against the <unk> to three years , and 10 months of the world .
i want to come into an .
so , i judgment of two years , because of a dangerous <unk> .
i was convicted of <unk> and <unk> <unk> with <unk> .
so , through my participation in <unk> has to actually my whole life changed .
and what to me was important , was this <unk> , the same as well .
because there was my , my absolute <unk> .
i was n't <unk> , '' ' i almost to say , yeah .
i 've got back goals , and as the tip .
i 've got back into perspective of mine . i 've got back to jump forward at it .
and you go with a very different kind of consciousness and consciousness from the prison out .
so far it 's always more <unk> without a fixed set goals and then is you know , in and anything <unk> .
with the wrong people together and this now .
well , the problem is , many no assistance systems have , if the out .
that the biggest problem , because then it 's automatically , which , that you go back in the old , backward .
you know , nothing else .
by this <unk> individual <unk> , no matter what 's all being offered it has to start with me just my whole mindset of me putting yourself , about other , over the people interact with issues , over the people interact with the society , that has to start with me just as these two weeks , completely around .
i 've been <unk> of my first woman in divorce .
and has been happening internationally , six months . bye '' i go back with her .
so that means , we have a new relationship started .
and because i bought one of the , through this whole <unk> and many other things change . i .
so much . i ' i 've achieved .
i 'm with my family back in plain the education started .
so i work today in my <unk> , '' ' i say .
i do , just a <unk> to <unk> .
you know that actually acknowledge that , very , many people are the fact , for my mentor , now , about this time , and actually about being , i do n't know , <unk> engagement , beyond the people to support .
i 'm grateful for this is , they the idea of all came out there are , that they so what do .
i 'm grateful for this is , they it , with certainty , who he pulled , and i 'm extremely grateful , that i would be part of having me .
that are some of course , the people , the support , the way and it .
i like i said , with many people at the events which , and the me , confirmed have this is good , that go back .
and it 's going ' i 's also do .
and to say , i thank you .
they come up with us to jail .
each of you have something that we need .
if you our participants in their <unk> the outcome , if you know when the <unk> to come from us whether they in the frame of a financial support that are .
if you know , our program in a new <unk> want to wear , very <unk> issue .
so they us , please .

and look for us on the conversation with them .
thank you .
<unk> i got involved in <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> <unk> in nepal <unk> .
in a time in the time i do something that way .
because you do , these things .
now , for <unk> for .
the <unk> go .
a sabbatical in the monastery .
there 's yes , today really are many ways as you with <unk> deal .
specifically as you <unk> deal .
anyway , i was <unk> also a way .
with my work and so 'n bit with the <unk> .
which i 'm here 's really kind of <unk> talk to .
and not from real problems .
my problem was i was <unk> and i could tell me pretty much what could color as my life in 10 or two , 30 years will look .
it was <unk> .
and this predictability i found rather frightening .
to it at least , to express .
basically , i had an adult <unk> crisis .
for the private .
i knew just not going to the <unk> way to happen ?
do it me just going ?
or what if i mean <unk> back to throw this ?
and look , then what happens .
what then on me wait .
this was so , the idea .
i was in this time , free <unk> at one day .
as i <unk> .
the <unk> was for me , despite <unk> the absolute <unk> .
you fluently , you look at the world 's living in very good hotels and fluently , this country on a very <unk> way , and the way .
fluently , but occasionally , also very <unk> countries .
the developing countries where it sure anymore to see , and say that counts as about <unk> with villages and kindly <unk> people for the , though they have nothing , so much greater happiness and pleasure of broadcast .
that kind of these images and from cliché about living , but really chronicles a way too .
and that was for me after a while the kicker .
i was that what i did to little bit .
to data .
and i found it 's a little <unk> of me about a country to write to judge that i really did n't really know .
that i wanted to change .
i wanted to countries , right to know .
to <unk> writing articles to discover .
and to my personal passion to be breastfeeding .
how you are better know ?
by showing you with the people who lives .
at the people who lives , at them home .
not in the hotel .
by showing you with the challenges and with the problems of people really busy .
and so as you with the people who works .
at least was that the answer , that i went on this question to do .
and that i wanted to do .
and i wanted something meaningful lives .
i wanted a contribute at .
something to do good .
and that has to start with me , at a <unk> further . it increases .
i was it had already too often in developing world , nepal , has just blew me , particularly touched .
until <unk> was there 's a 10 year-old civil war in the not just many orphans , but also lots of economic and social problems , and left .
with an annual income of <unk> of nepal is the poorest country in asia .
and it 's going to keep in the two decades , the poorest countries .
a quarter of the population lives below the poverty .
almost a fifth of the population suffer from malnutrition .
forty percent of the adult male ca n't read and writing .
all these are connected with very many personal stories and experiences , that i on this journey has had met at me in a time in the time i was willing and frankly it was to change .
in the time i even a change .
and drum up after my return of nepal and my decision .
i quit my job .
and on me at the aid .
and i <unk> ' now , just an excerpt from the answer to return that i on my job application received .
because they just a defining who was .
it 's going to a serious amazed at <unk> international by a company .
and not to a <unk> for a <unk> <unk> that you know that time in nepal want to live and a funding of living for .
hi ?
let 's still alive ?
i was really seriously , meaning and good .
at least i thought that .
and this answer was a <unk> <unk> .
i was really do unplug .
and i ' course , quite a profound emotional response .
and fortunately , never <unk> .
instead . i ' i do this , right at the feeling being taken to what good <unk> .
i it used as an engine , to my own business to start moving .
<unk> .
heart . labeled and soul <unk> .
a company that basically , that offers , what i then for .
because the way , a country unlike to do .
the way , a country right to meet .
by i do with the people , in life and work .
and it 's not anywhere can work , but in to <unk> .
<unk> you can actually in the two words , though .
so karma , and <unk> .
that means , so , place in which you good so karma can gather .
in which you do good .
so this is now 'n little bit <unk> .
but it 's not .
<unk> is a social <unk> business .
we use the tourism , as a tool for sustainable development .
specifically what we use <unk> as a tool for sustainable development .
so <unk> , volunteering and unsustainable tourism .
because the people , the with us to go to do in your living meaningful volunteering that .
they pay for their journey , just like a different organizers .
but they travel , it works differently .
you live in <unk> .
and the main objective is not least amount of recovery or as much <unk> but the real <unk> exchange .
social engagement .
and we broaden .
to speak to our participants ever , qualification , and interests in various projects .
we can go through our work for a gentle tourism , which increase the otherwise , no chance on the classic tourism , have .
because just that infrastructure that 's missing .
for others , we can send sustainable design projects will increase .
we can reduce their sustainable design projects -- and finance .
we 're so to a hundred percent .
are also on not donations to .

now we have to our work <unk> in nepal .
convenes a year we have our engagement in uganda expanding .
and now after about four years turned to us now i got married and my husband and i are also for a team was a <unk> question .
we take the <unk> gone further ?
or what if we still more of thinking ?
if we the <unk> further . this ?
if we do with this is not only social engagement and sustainable to go into my life , but in rules of wholeness that ?
and so , the individual <unk> have them ?
or still from individual <unk> .
that would then basically , a new one extra company .
a company , that , at the company itself .
with other <unk> but the same philosophy , how <unk> .
we want this ?
i was the next question .
'n new business ?
sure that we want this .
we love social entrepreneur and their creative companies .
because we become a ticking .
because we the same language .
because we the same as dreams were dreaming .
because we the challenges to understand .
and why we 've done in this year <unk> one sister , given .
<unk> .
and with <unk> and we 're creative companies in its development and start <unk> that we by an extraordinary people to support .
to accompany we the participants , entrepreneur , or some collaborators from the creative companies with individual development <unk> .
so <unk> the personal social and <unk> `` of <unk> which do .
and <unk> the the <unk> prepare .
so , if there 's at <unk> , again .
a matter of the next to a meaningful <unk> still one more huge .
he shows a in relatively short time , where you is , or where you <unk> .
where you may still unknown to going to .
where you might want to me a very flexible , which is , to <unk> in thinking .
and he shows a on , what you really good .
the it in his strength , eyes .
it 's the creativity , the sudden , great .
or whether it 's the serenity and that you new in the self .
the serenity and things we assume that you do n't change .
and the power , things to change , that you can change .
and you very much change .
already in very short time .
we know that .
an example .
that are <unk> rose <unk> , named lydia and <unk> .
that are five very wonderful women from uganda .
with a sad fortunes and with a talent .
they would be a beautiful , caught <unk> for years .
and for years happened .
because they simply no market for .
because they did n't know , as you the quality of improving .
because you nobody has said , which design may be in the question is .
we wanted to these women help .
and have so in this year , a <unk> started .
<unk> <unk> <unk> .
products that people out of poverty , get .
that you a guaranteed income there .
a future in the lives .
we 're beautifully yesterday with our <unk> live , we 've gone .
and we start with a first <unk> edition .
a <unk> edition of thousands <unk> of our women .
the sales , you to do n't just for a year , an income .
but allows us , this is still much larger pattern .
this first edition , is sort of social crowd <unk> and <unk> in one .
so who are going to , can this for one with the purchase a way to make the other day , it , but with us , straight into the project to travel .
he can be able to the women and travel to actively <unk> .
the long will we 're not only five women a job there , but fifty or a hundred .
and that 's not just in uganda , but in nepal and in other <unk> , in which we <unk> work .
this is , but this <unk> just a project from our possibility , cycle . their projects .
we 're working in all of areas .
in <unk> <unk> and health and <unk> and <unk> .
because the work in the only one area . bit .
what happens with the kids when the women who work ?
right .
so we have in this year in nepal and in uganda , two <unk> centre , started .
it reaches in our own cycle on each other .
and the power to be more sense , as any one project for yourself .
in place where we 've ever , qualification , in the different projects .
the grain of ways to be wondering , then , just in the joy of work .
and just wanted to i 'm so now , right on a journey with you .
and please , i 'm so the eyes to close .
reset , you , you 're in africa .
in rural heart of uganda .
you 're sitting on a wooden dining room .
and you are satisfied and you .

there 's <unk> .
<unk> .
tasty .
the walls are <unk> .
in there is it 's warm .
you <unk> out the window .
and see these kids in the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
their <unk> feet tumble through the sand on .
you <unk> on your <unk> .
also on them is a thin layer <unk> dust .
the kids will laugh .
and calls for fun your name .
you <unk> you that they do you do n't even more than just <unk> .
<unk> .
you know , not , what time it 's .
but soon , you going to get up .
and the <unk> , the men 's still the kids were , <unk> .
the end of the street is a tree .
here you going to lydia .
in the meadow , sitting in the shadows of the tree as you like the new designs of <unk> talk about .
like , you with my hands and feet to talk .
later come from now the other women .
they smile , you <unk> .
until you with your english to start .
the tree .
in .
unbelievable , that it 's still an internet , there .
this morning <unk> you back with your coach .
that <unk> you .
the exchange is every time value .
and it 's beautiful time again , and german .
you 're hearing about music .
and that <unk> of <unk> .
mom <unk> washing in the courtyard , the pots in decline .
they sing an african proverb that song .
you are relaxed , and happy .
you are the eyes peering back on .
each of us can the <unk> to be wondering , on something new engage .
now , or for a short time the dice me back to throw .
and to look what happens .
thank you .
before i start , would take interest me , whether of you tonight is , that they 're here , time someone 'n ' house , that .
i just know , with the light it does n't really well , but perhaps want to someone woke up .
there , i just know , i got someone .
two .
here , just know , i 'm not , but , there are already passed , two , that 's beautiful , we 're already passed , to <unk> .
i ' , a building up and it 's the villa mountain in east , the city <unk> .
this is the building .
and with two decades , the other people got madd '' i the villa out in the last summer , six months for up there .
and so stuck , i tonight is here from them .
well , and , like now some of you might say .
so what 's also ?
<unk> there 's `` yes , many .
but i want it for just .
well , you used up now the villa along ?
and you <unk> then the park or how ?
just a small group selection of the questions , that we know , friends , colleagues have asked when they 've learned , that i became part of an initiative , i whistle , to , something <unk> name , <unk> am .
all those , that we reconnect seamlessly in the series of <unk> <unk> .
and here 's around to these villa <unk> you had , <unk> all that and so we put up .
and to the privatization of a villa out to protesting .
but who i know , you know that 's not my kind of <unk> .
and it was also not the elected <unk> the initiative .
what we see here , is a sign of the <unk> passage in <unk> .
this is a public space , the one you privately simply is , and so for many people do n't available to it says , <unk> ' i do n't say , but this is not in public hand is , and why not that could be used , how to public spaces may use .

and we wanted to a different <unk> tell you .
we were a <unk> team and that i must now very quickly see , because it was a very <unk> team .
from the areas of architecture , planning , social -- , politics -- and <unk> <unk> , statistics , design , music , photography <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
now , simultaneously , with different social and cultural and personal <unk> .
our perspectives <unk> and highly enriched .
and have allows us , in different skills , but also in various networks <unk> .
and creative in part unconventional solutions in the <unk> , then we did have , <unk> to realize .
we 've actually navigated directly , the villa out to occupy .
but it was a 's us about that we villa with stories and ideas being .
we have to early memories and i 'm asking .
and out of those memories and images out to model , of the outlook for the villa out to develop .
and it was us to the process , a constructive ; it remains .
us as an initiative for yourself , we 've been with all say , <unk> platform and as <unk> terms .
it was <unk> a <unk> and emotional signal being , and was , and to try to <unk> .
the experiences , that we have , and they 've done , <unk> ' i tonight is to go .
every city has <unk> places .
the a neighborhood a face .
in many ways by this , inferred and commercialized and be in the result of citizens , strangers are perceived .
they are the dead -- a city because you just a lot is not the equivalent , what we asked in public space and expect .
so for example that we <unk> have , <unk> .
are these , but also the fact , public , the urban places , neglected , this is a lot is lying .
initiatives , the places like that would want to stay in many , <unk> interest , in the infancy to do .
what 's also with me to do , like it 's some questions , like some outside of questions .
i mean , a lot .
these places , giving our town , not just a face .
no .
they are the social places of the city , in the our social life is happening .
so how we there are often the first <unk> be to our neighbors , if we wanted to the way shopping to meet .
and can take this increase , if we just an ai to have , to sit , and we actually stop , if the spaces , designed accordingly .
and we just 'n longer you 'll have .
it to form friendships , sometimes .
but what 's certainly going to it 's a sense of the community .
the more who i have , and in this is a public space . i , more and faster and more gradually it 's also that community .
and when i 'm not <unk> , which is just that , what you probably the memory of a big city called .
we were then , two challenges .
we can look at the citizens of consciousness , `` stewardship and engagement for your neighborhood up or in <unk> also <unk> .
how can a protest in the creation be transformed ?
how can make reasonable criticism in the ideas to be transformed ?
a protest against the privatization , and <unk> this <unk> <unk> places and preoccupation with the power to cruise and actually also not in which <unk> of the same places .
imagine if you now , that they sit here , again , they beat the newspaper , and reading over the text .
i love to empower and citizens , we invite you a we want you three things varieties , for the redesigning the <unk> imagine that have a before carefully <unk> <unk> designed by .
they must be in the following off at the idea of a nuance , pick .
and the variation , with the most <unk> is then <unk> implemented .
they would go ?
would any of them to this event , go ?
probably not .
why not ?
i mean , it sounds , first time a great .
there 's a way , select .
they ca <unk> , like this in the future , here .
and again , it sounds , first time it in the first moment .
i trial , let me , at an explanation .
and it , because i the i 'm they ca n't really has or pick up or shape , <unk> .
first , because the classic <unk> often too late to <unk> .
that is , mostly they do n't have a chance , really , your suggestions to make or some alternatives to have , but there 's actually been downloaded a design and they ca <unk> still going to decide , if you <unk> or <unk> in the city , green plants .
or , like a friend of other day said , what color the trash can have for example .
second one explanation about classical <unk> 's rarely spoke about information and vote out .
if you see at the three <unk> varieties .
we have is what , that we want to show you , and they must then you can vote .
the frustration and incomprehension -- are often the following what i also kind of which is .
i have to any decision about <unk> or <unk> meeting when i actually be downloaded a <unk> route , instead <unk> <unk> had .
it goes , but also different .
although we thought about overcoming the existing <unk> of conversations that cost has we have finally too much disturbed about .
so , then we have experience up and the , i for other <unk> share .
i want it too , to other initiatives , to other projects , but also , or so , at the city and at the policy .
because of the ones who are , the ones that <unk> actually able to and the really responsible for these redundant processes are .
because if you really the interest in what is , it so often to struggle and let 's then we and then we need them so that new <unk> .
do n't last <unk> ' i but also at all of them , that you today , sit here .
and it 's why , because i <unk> for very important to think .
i know , it for important is , they all of go , and i want them with our sample of encouraging dissent , the <unk> still a chance to give you .
and i then at me and they all , because you who are , the at the them a new <unk> demand .
so we have to what happens if you look like , to look at the citizens of consciousness , `` stewardship and engagement for your neighborhood and got to participation and <unk> to stir up ?
first about willingness to the dialogue going on the field .
in <unk> for professionals in a reporter , citizens on <unk> and of interest them .
what we see here , is a picnic table , to the we invited .
what we see here , are some <unk> and <unk> in conversation with citizens .
the goal to be , that all these conversations on the field on today , so , that 's not the <unk> interests , or the <unk> skills about the missing in the citizens .
the citizens , there are experts , they 're experts to their neighborhood , you know , what you missing , which <unk> they do with a place to connect , in which tradition , a place is , and also , what you a place , lacking .
the <unk> , especially in the city can see , what on <unk> level in the project to do .
the domain alone or in in a particular case , can then another <unk> be involved in the subjects to make up , that 's on the project for are , ever being .
all this leads to a <unk> , in the rest of information for all available , are and the then the place right .
by maybe , you get to be able , the an identification of where that allows .
a dialogue going on the field is also , the wishes of a resident in fact taken seriously .
and it 's also then , if somebody says , i want a <unk> the marketplace .
and that can course , complete , he got to be , but the goal to be , in <unk> dialog with all of <unk> , which is the right solution and maybe in <unk> , the <unk> to do , but maybe in one another place .
well , this must go out of conversation turns out then you come up .
second point are diverse <unk> .
our <unk> 's colorful .
one feels to be completely comfortable , when he said , <unk> large group is , and you can talk .
a different from it 's good writing to but the text and then not , <unk> large group .
a different to what might be happy or photographing it .
or building his ideas in <unk> <unk> on .
what i say it tries to have to different <unk> give to different market society that .
we have here for the way , just to come , there are to actually , first time to watch , what happens .
the back , downloaded a small exhibition .
we have is the possibility of out , <unk> to give you .
we have the possibility of out , to paint .
we have the possibility of out , to write .
from the age .
this was a <unk> girl .
we had the way , our ideas with their faces to connect to take up to <unk> .
also the way , outside of <unk> <unk> to participate , should always been .
and that can for example of a <unk> happen , that can think about <unk> <unk> happen .
the basis , and transparent having the results of the dialogue , the united states are .
we even have the entire process in parallel postulate on facebook with him and on one of independent blog , news <unk> about a <unk> .
our third point <unk> .
you remember wondering , maybe it , that i said that <unk> often too late to be happening .
in my <unk> event there 's already know , rearranging <unk> .
<unk> 's the process , but then when it 's very early intervention happening and them so that best , even more could n't know , with <unk> we need to happen to .
if through the dialogue , and i 'm going back to the point , and just gotten , discussed this is , which of scenarios for a site in the question .
<unk> heard , for <unk> itself .
and it then , if not from the beginning to have no idea is that the <unk> event like , and so you have , but the experiences from the previous self-assembles .
what happens now , if the citizens in your city will find and your city <unk> .
it 's already in a bunch of projects in .
i , let 's an example from <unk> , this is the <unk> , is probably at you here .
in new york was just a project launched , there 's about a <unk> .
in <unk> <unk> 're there 's inside of six weeks <unk> dollars to come together the funding has been able to do now , or <unk> .
the time has to in august i wrote the politics , he could not unlike , as the idea to their own .
also the <unk> in new york , to the i think , i 'm not anymore to say , because he has to one of the <unk> the city 's become was no idea of politics or educational administration .
the point , the <unk> for the <unk> were already .
in <unk> , so we 're back in germany would have the citizens , so stunning plans to very essence of a sense , again , or almost .
the city was told <unk> is n't necessary .
the four weeks <unk> , that we for <unk> <unk> have , the rich very different than <unk> .
today is the <unk> the city , offline .
during the side <unk> d e there it works and the city the <unk> , the initiative , the way . there 's started , and other <unk> supported .
and elsewhere , painting for their own crossing in the road .
in rotterdam in a <unk> <unk> .
all worked so far , you want now say .
then we do , but now , just so on .
but i think it for the wrong , the city of the responsibility to them .
why ?
for one , because they yes a look for a 's all have or should have .
during the dedicated , it be the citizens of initiatives , or businesses , in the rule on a for them in some form the relevant than in the focus has the city against the responsibility for the projects , the also the attention .
and the other of course , the city of the projects are taking , are other tool available to .
a <unk> initiative to be in this only <unk> of priority .
also our goal was actually a an initiative that , she tells you planned that was roughly half a year of the results and the responsibility to the city , who wanted .

it 's going to still there .
so we have , now in the problem , that we have still not come from it could .
but we know , now , that , if the city of the villa successful <unk> , if the negotiations can actually are successful , that then a <unk> place .
in what form of happening , however , is still remain open .
to the end to come and i 'm convinced of , that many projects , the by their meaning , complexity or , cost of the city has evolved to have a chance of happiness that 's blessing and identification , to create .
if you just in time and the conversation with the citizens <unk> .
in other figured out of the city and citizens .
in other figured out of the city and you all , that you tonight is sitting here .
if we put them on , the fall because the <unk> the citizens did n't even more than you stop working well , but as profitable .
this is it .
last night , the <unk> we were here in <unk> in <unk> and are so the <unk> come .
we have about <unk> talked .
so this idea , still a second chance to have , if it in this life does n't work out that has , just another time a second chance .
we found very exciting .
and we were , relatively quickly to agree that , two things that there , that we 're not yet , we 're going to move .
this one is the puberty .
the second , there was also , by the table . it was time in the school ?
no way .
no way .
school , some of you remember wondering , may still suggesting out <unk> .
at me is it , so , are now that <unk> years ago , but the words , lead , i immediately to <unk> hands .
my neck straps , and i just want to go back on a 's the loo .
and then i 'm not , it on you was , but in my exams , was then , `` the one that with the <unk> taken seriously , has , the was always the next to me .
no idea , what 's from the fact become .
they 're going to understand it , so , my school was really not beautiful and after i then my final <unk> behind me do was completely clear , never again , school .
and so what i now say , when i on the year <unk> back of the most days , that i because i 've got another , i ' i in schools have spent .
with a desire and which is a volunteer .
how she was there 's that ?
like this happened ?
that just started , so , that something happens is , what i do n't do calculating .
i got kids .
so , my wife eventually got the children .
and therefore i was actually , very clearly , that you who is , the way . to this <unk> to take care .
to the one day , when they said , honey , it 's <unk> .
and today are you .
yes , <unk> .
because i opened the door and then i was sitting there is sort of in this <unk> , whoa , i felt thrown in the <unk> .
that looked like that out , it back at us the way .
and that made , still so how to school at it made , and i <unk> ' gim me , human being here has , yes , real failure .
and when i then the teacher , say , and you know , the kids learn not for the school , but for a 's live there <unk> ' i , oh my god , the sentence . i ' i mean , then , not <unk> .
what is that , what we from the school , from this high school , for a 's life really shut down to have ?
so many of us have <unk> there really good thing .
where they 've actually in your life <unk> already passed , really well , we can ?
and maybe you know some yet , like the capital from yugoslavia means .
what 's still time in yugoslavia ?
or <unk> , that capacity in short time equal terms of knowledge in the <unk> , just , so i do it , at a button again <unk> can , until i really going ?
well , i ' that time needed for the <unk> , but otherwise ?
and what 's a <unk> of one point is about it out whether someone , a good doctor picks it ?
if the empathic , is , and if the good and diagnostic of has ?
no way .
so , no way , for a 's life , not for the school , we learn .
if we so back , so roughly <unk> years , the middle of <unk> century , like that yes , you have .
this is the time , in the time in germany , the <unk> then eventually gets completely was introduced .
and where we also the educational system , how we it today has , its roots .
and if we the time , then imagine , it was actually so , the people at the had no access to know their time .
and there were these four or six years , that they 're kind of forced by , in the school to go and to know , of our subjects were that were then we really the only way , that had to begin with the knowledge and the facts and the information in their time in to come .
now has a <unk> more information in his pocket and as the library of time .
and the middle of <unk> century , that was the time the industrialization .
that is , there has to a big changes in the world and there were suddenly humans need , that these new machines that could .
the same time were but also human needs , that these machines , wait , and repair it could .
and we need people , that these machines to build it could and that these factories were running .
maybe you do it .
this <unk> system , that we now in germany at you imagine still have , has its root in this time .
and a potentially make sense .
also , because it was probably really that was , that , what i at school because i 've got madd '' for the work on the assembly line well , who the assembly line up , the stood there be for life .
we do <unk> at in the future .
we let that <unk> century , where it is , and we look at this year <unk> .
this year <unk> was this year , there was the first <unk> just before to pop .
i was with my studies done , and i thought , now is the time , now do you fall on , the first company .
yes , after some of them to around me so with the internet , <unk> ' i , <unk> ' i think that now , this time .
and some corporations are at us <unk> and they were always gets bigger and always gets bigger , and we 're so beautiful slow grown , and some of the companies are then at us again , so in <unk> .
you see , always two times in life .
and we had then after a few years , 30 staff .
so , we had so , such a growth and we had so interesting thing about careers on board , like <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
i do n't know , whether they downloaded a concrete idea that they have , what these people do , but when i school . went we had no idea that , so what ever give you would .
even when i <unk> did was from so what 's like the internet . it was n't talk .
and the children , that we now to school . send the job to the in 10 , have thought , twenty or 30 years have ?
the only honest answer <unk> we have no idea .
and , which you know , which are going to the need to in those future jobs to succeed ?
and if you 're honest , because the only answer , we have no idea .
and because we 've been so in the future looking , who could tell me , because the <unk> for the saturday , there .
there 's <unk> golden ticket , i ' i read .
well , you see , they have no idea .
how we can get then out , what school for a 's lives learning it ?
what are the things , that we need to kids for a 's life being unfit to do ?
and maybe help people like a lens , in this , what companies today . their employees to go .
that are , the <unk> of school , yeah ?
the alumni from schools and the universities , then in the company .
and if you like a classic <unk> at , then it 's look at first place , so what , like the expertise .
because i want . yes , so the reading , and so , we 're <unk> <unk> <unk> with 10 years <unk> and this traveled 12 years in offshore .
this is going to school , and also in the future ca n't afford .

and that you can basically , in three discrete groups to summarize .
this is for one , businesses , want to their employees , the fact that are , flexibility in this is a .
then you want to almost all their employees to be entrepreneurial .
and then you want to these companies , the <unk> .
so we have the flexibilities of leaders , thinking and predicts all .
we start with the flexibility .
this is relatively quickly to comprehend .
if we look , how economies to work , how fast , yes , how fast , anything changes .
<unk> , yes , the whole business models are the internet of today , the morning , their head .
there 's got madd '' i , the with this change can deal .
there 's got madd '' i , that are creative .
there 's got madd '' i , the <unk> .
this is quite just the opposite of what in the factory in the <unk> century of collaborators at the assembly line is needed .
also the second subject of the entrepreneurial think is quite clear .
there 's about the responsibility .
there 's about people , the take responsibility .
first time for , and their own life .
but also for that telescope .
if that 's now , the company is , or , as a society and wish we are the take responsibility for that telescope .
and the third factor , that predicts that 's almost the most they really .
and if we 're looking at the soccer cup , remember , then there 's because the internet for this beautiful saying .
argentina , has <unk> <unk> portugal , has <unk> and germany has a team .

that 's the only thing we do .
and also that somebody , this big one innovator our time , steve jobs , <unk> .
it was not the , of the iphone , invented has , the has not the <unk> invented , the has a massive itunes n't invented , the has nothing that i was invented .
the had a team , that this possible has done , because just as a team began to the do that what they 've done .
so a school , that these three things to be , that if only but a school , in the we for a 's lives learning .
but there 's still <unk> fourth thing and the is me almost more important .
and this is learning .
if the only , what we think about the future with certainty , we can tell is , you an uncertainty is then is , the ability , and new to learn and fun and to have this learning to the <unk> that , that we in later life , and that our children in later life are successful .
that if only ' yet a school , that these things .
but where i was ?
i sat in this <unk> and the of them , the kids have , the know , that 's not just downloaded a wonderful event is , for the you <unk> to pay .
so a wonderful event , sort of like all it said , but still not from each other .
to the time , where <unk> 're elected , there are then suddenly all the invisible .
yes , i was sitting there and what i say , the <unk> one of my kids were these <unk> still the funniest lists of the event .
less fun , it was for me as a father , if you so the stress about to the subject of homework and learn this whole family <unk> .
and still less fun makes it , if the child was sick staff is , because at school , stress has come .
and finally ended up this <unk> or was a peak of <unk> at this school , again , so 'n <unk> .
just took it was also not <unk> , it was like it 's a <unk> , so right after the last one hour and in fact , we were also the single parents , that were invited .
and i <unk> , you now , and also reminded me the fine-scale detail by the time after the point was clear , we need to our child 's take out , that 's not .
<unk> are , but two years , in which we did have , because it 's done anything .
what do we really wrong ?
and we had to actually the question , which is our child , fail ?
and we are the only , where it 's about ?
now . i ' i in the last two years , since i said in the subject i 'm involved with very many people , and i ' realized , no way . i ' learned , you 're not alone .

and what i say , he has to me almost the same story with one of his children , he has almost as we experienced as we , and that we had been fortunate that we our children there 's take you could take out of school , yeah ?
in berlin , there 's one , it ai <unk> at different schools and we could even a charter schools in into account .
but can that everyone out there are doing ?
it was us that to little bit , just our children in safety to enter and this world out there be like to make it , how they are .
and after we both right now the impression that had , school has , since we were there is not that really changed we thought , yeah well , we are the first , the topic that now , do .
it , how shall we as <unk> there anything to change ?
the good thing is , we be fooled .
we 're not alone .
but we have a relatively fast as a whole range of amazing people found that , what the like to how we , which is a school to create , the following everybody who are doing right .
it is yes , not true that just the children and their parents to the suffering , what out there 's often happens .
if we the teachers to look , 30 percent of teachers have <unk> .
if we look , how to the number <unk> in the last 10 years has changed the has to double .
it can now be , that all parents to be doing ?
that all children dying are and that , those teachers broken we are ?
or it be , that we have a system have , that just not more like this fits , like this <unk> ago <unk> years , the fit just as well . so right .
and we have many people found , where it gets that went and we 've even people found , the not have children .
and they 've got it is , they take responsibility to the future that you take responsibility to the future , you take responsibility for that , what we our children and the kids , the right now to school . go , with the way to give you .
and we 've got to <unk> second point gotten there 's out there ai of like you have initiatives , the school to change you want , and there 's there 's <unk> schools , here and there really cool thing <unk> and there 's almost at every school teacher , the really involved , are and a change you want .
and there 's even the a one or bold principal , the , then also <unk> the first step to go .
and how we should now as <unk> help ?
we had , no concept , that we are there is now about helping us could .
but we can make one do , we can in those schools , and we can in these schools in the people , the school in is , so the parents , the teachers and the students , together and we can with are in two days a lot of this move .
there are so people together , in the past , like it against things have worked and the learning in two days , what it together to work .
that come with <unk> very first challenge that they share them .
and after two of those days have the then for a new <unk> developed sooner or the gun , for a totally new to high as we 're in berlin to school , you 're dealing with you .
or the have a concrete things for <unk> problems , that you in your school have , evolved .
inside of two days in developed new approaches , the next day , and implemented .
but what that i could is , at these two days happens , and that makes it for me and so beautiful , the small weekends , that i , then also time to schools in all of germany to spend , is this energy , that there is when the three things to learn .

so sort of the leaders , thinking and if you try to a team to experience .
then is that an antenna sparks , the , etc. .
and if we are four weeks after that <unk> workshop . it ai n't manage to come back then you know , we realized that , the school as a whole has , to change , that there ai n't entirely new musical culture that 's .
and this is incredible hot .
and i <unk> ' they time i invite them over the school to think .
i <unk> ' they time i invite men , about education was thinking .
and i <unk> ' they do so , also to invite men , about , of school , to talk .
so you about this , what you like to talk , they do it , what you do n't like .
they will be surprised , how much disturbed , they get and how many people did the have experienced , but just not talking about it .
you make us , you make us on every school in germany , the <unk> century among them .
you make us the entire system to change .
and you make us this together to do with the people to the school day for a day , and see with the parents , the teachers and the students .
because only thing we can we do this .
thank you .
