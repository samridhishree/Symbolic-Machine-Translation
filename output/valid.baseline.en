you know , one of the <unk> the travel and one of your bliss in the <unk> research is , who share with the people to live , the way . still at the old days you can remember . the your past , still in the wind will feel , you on the rain <unk> of touch , you in the bitter dregs of the leaves the plants [ taste .
just that to know , <unk> still living beyond the milky way to travel , or the importance of myth the oldest on the inuit -- still covered with what are , or that the himalayas and the buddhists reflect levels still the breath of <unk> tracking , which means , the central epiphany of physical anthropology research into memory to shout out , that 's the idea , the world , in the we live , not in a total of exists , but just as a model of reality , and as a a group of certain ways of these things that we know , <unk> succeed , many generations of chose .
and of course , what we all the same <unk> .
we 're all born . we get kids to the world .
we go through <unk> .
we need to the <unk> separation of the death of interest and it should we 're not surprise , that we all the singing , dancing and and art out .
but there 's the unique vocal cadence of <unk> , the rhythm of the dance in every culture .
and plays it does n't matter , whether it happen to the <unk> in the forest of borneo -- is , or the <unk> in haiti , or the warrior down in the <unk> of <unk> , the <unk> in the andes , or a <unk> in the sahara . this is to the colleague , i a month ago in the desert , across am . or even a <unk> at the hanging of <unk> , everest , the <unk> the world .
all these people teach us that , it yet another <unk> , other ways of thinking , other ways to an orientation in the earth there .
and this is an idea , the , when you think about , a deal with just hope they can .
together and the spread of the world a net of <unk> and cultural life , that the earth <unk> and for that 's the earth as important is , like that biological <unk> , and this biosphere that 's better .
you can be wondering , this cultural <unk> as a <unk> imagine . <unk> can and as the sum of thoughts and dreams , which is the ideas , inspirations -- and everything , the of the human imagination ever since the beginnings of consciousness , generated by , be defined .
the <unk> is the great legacy of humanity .
they did this symbol of all of , what we 're and what we as an amazing <unk> species are .
and the biosphere to wear away by , did this with the <unk> -- with just doing even greater our velocity .
not a biologist to allow for example , dare to say , that 50 percent or more for all kinds of a moment in the extinct we are , there 's just not true . and yet , this -- that <unk> <unk> in the area of biodiversity -- it 's hardly the , which gives us as <unk> <unk> in the area of cultural diversity , is .
and the critical to be for that is a number of languages .
than any of them in this room was born , were on the earth are 6,000 different languages spoken language .
now is a language not just the totality of the vocabulary belongs , or a series of <unk> .
a language is an expression of human spirit .
she 's a means , with the soul of a culture has access to the material world finds .
every language is like a <unk> forest of mind , a point , a thought , an ecosystem of spiritual .
and of that are 6,000 different languages are today , while we here in monterey , sit , exactly half the speed . in the ears of children <unk> .
they 're going infants do n't even more things . that is , if nothing done is , they 're actually been dead .
what might be lonely be , from silence <unk> to be , one of your people to be , the your language to talk , no way to have , the wisdom of our science , or the hope for children . ?
and yet , stamp this horrible , which he actually , somebody somewhere on the earth , 10 . all the two weeks , because of two weeks , you kill a older , man and take the last <unk> an indication of with rhinovirus . the grave .
and i know , that some of you say , it 's no better than that ? '' was the world 's not a better place , if we all just a language to be ? '' and i 'm saying , '' well , let this language , yoruba . let them <unk> be .
let them kogi . ''
and then they would suddenly realize , it would , if you their own language not could talk .
so i want you today a statement on a voyage through the <unk> take , a short journey through the <unk> to try , you get to do , which actually been lost .
now there 's some of us , the way , forget , that i , when i say `` different ways of being , '' really different ways of being mean .
take them for this child the <unk> in the northwest of the amazon , the nation of <unk> , believe that they <unk> the <unk> from east , in the belly of latter-day saints , snakes <unk> .
this is a people , which is not being cognitively far between the colors , blue , and green is different , because that <unk> the forest , of the people depend on , <unk> is .
they have a dip to language and a <unk> the linguistic <unk> is called , you have to marry someone , the one another language , talks .
so all this is rooted in the mythological past . that appear to be at this big houses , in which of <unk> six or seven languages spoken to be , is , is , that you never catching somebody said , the learn a language .
you 're just to and start then .
or , one of the <unk> tribes , which i ever lived have , the <unk> in the northeast of ecuador , an amazing people , the first , in 1958 , peaceful and i contacted by the world .

they threw a new photographs of , from the air down , what we as kind , with them would . and forgetting that you that these people from the rainforest in her still never be something <unk> had seen .

but the <unk> were not only people with the spear .
they <unk> each other .
54 percent of the deaths were happening through <unk> .
we followed the <unk> eight generations go back and found two million cases of natural death and when we the people with really something about <unk> , gave them to , that one of the people that old become was that , it because of his age , and we were killing him still with the spear .
but the same time they had a clear -- knowledge of forests , the amazing .
they were hunters who were the urine of an animal from 40 up to smell and determine , to which species , this was on .
in the early <unk> years i received a really amazing job , when i was my professor in the harvard , he said , if i believe it be interested , after i was to go and the secret societies to infiltrate , the the foundation of the strength of <unk> and <unk> <unk> was and the venom , that this was used to <unk> to do , sure .
to this sensation having a sense to give you had , i want something about this really think of <unk> know , and <unk> is not a cult of the black magic .
the point , it 's going to start to a complex , forget about the world .
it 's interesting .
if i asked them to ask , the great world , or , what they would say ?
christianity , islam , in buddhism , <unk> or whatever .
a continent will always leave out , because that he was that , in sub-saharan africa is not religious faith to give him . course there 's a and <unk> 's just the dawning of these very prize-winning religious thought , the during the tragic diaspora , the <unk> <unk> .
but what <unk> so interesting , is this is a relationship between the living and the dead .
the living bear the spirit .
the spirit can of the point of water of evoking going to respond to the rhythm of the dance , to the soul of living in this temporarily leaving out to , so that the <unk> for a shiny moment for god will .
cram say the <unk> like , `` your white is in the church , and you talk about god .
we use dancing in the temples , and going to god . ''
and because you 're obsessed , me , you get from the mind that , you . how can you damage the third danger going ?
you see these amazing -- demonstrations , <unk> in one had been , the iron needle in coal , without the burning <unk> , an amazing an exhibition of the ability of mind the body like to impact , that it <unk> , if he was in a state of the extreme , arousal , who will .
now , of all people , that i met , to have , what was the kogi from the sierra nevada and de santa <unk> in <unk> , the most exceptional .
all around the old <unk> civilization , the <unk> plain from colombia , the world and in a result of conquest , moved to that people in a <unk> volcanic in no , that over the <unk> plain there .
in a <unk> continent , were these people are the only , the never of the <unk> conquered .
to this day , you will of a ritual that priesthood is king . the training to that priesthood , however , is very extraordinary .
the young <unk> be the age of three and four years of their families detached and in a <unk> world , the dark , in <unk> on a fab the glacier , for 18 years by that . two periods of at nine years , you 're elected , to the nine months of pregnancy emulate , that they in which of her mother to contribute , spend them now <unk> in which one of the mother .
and during this whole time , they are culturally express in the scores of society which effectively . values , the conclusion has n't want to make their prayer , and only their prayer , the cosmic scene -- or we can say that are ecological crisis , balance we sustain .
the end of these amazing <unk> they are no one day , suddenly , out and the first time in your life , the age of 18 years , you see a sunrise , and in this <unk> moment of consciousness of the first of light , when the sun 's starting on the <unk> the remarkably good , to radiation , is becoming suddenly everything , what they in abstract 've learned in scale of grandeur confirmed . and the priest , which is back and says , `` you see ? it 's really , i 'm so here .
it 's wonderful . you have it to protect . ''
they call yourself to the older brother and say , that we , that we the younger brother who are , for the destruction of the world , accountable .
now this level of intuition is very important .
you look , if we look at some indigenous and the landscape of thinking , <unk> we 're either <unk> and the old lady who of fancy side of up , which in his simplification of a <unk> idea is , or other thoreau and say , these people are more with the nature is connected , when we .
so , then aboriginal communities are n't sentimental , still going to them from the could see otherwise ill .
it is not a lot of room for in the <unk> swamps of <unk> or the cold twist of tibet , they have , but anyway , through time and my ritual a mysterious <unk> the world shaped , the not on the idea is based , you 're close to be , but on a far <unk> intuition , the idea , that the world at the only exist can , because they 're in the human consciousness <unk> of .
now , what that means .
it means that , a little girl from the andes , that in the think up , that the mountain in a <unk> is , of his or her destiny to determine , is a very , another person will , and a different relationship to this resource , or this place have , as a little girl from montana , that in the think up , that a mountain in a bunch of stone is , the away .
if he had a location of mind or a bunch <unk> is , is irrelevant .
this interesting is the metaphor , which the relationship between the individual and the nature is defined .
i grew up in the forest of british , colombia , and i believed that these forests that there are , <unk> .
this made me to a different people as my friends to the <unk> , the believe that these forests of the abode of <unk> and the curved <unk> and the <unk> they are , the <unk> the world where , righteous minds , that they 're looking at their <unk> can be .
now , if you start , the idea to look at that these cultures across various new realities , we can , you some of their extraordinary discoveries to understand . for example this plant here .
it 's a photo , that i just last april , in the northwest of the amazon , where we had .
this is <unk> , of a lot of you 've heard , the most personalize preparation out of a repertoire of the shamans live .
what <unk> so , is not just the <unk> potential that <unk> , but of processing . it will actually from two different sources that . the one side , there 's these wooden <unk> , that 's a series of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , hallucinogenic , to questions . these <unk> by taking that 's about as if we have to a blue <unk> smoke in their minds put , it 's , but with the leaves of <unk> from the family , the <unk> with the name <unk> <unk> up .
this plant which includes some very strong <unk> the front of serotonin , <unk> and <unk> very similar .


it 's no distortion of reality is , but the resolution of reality .
i have even with my professor , richard evan <unk> , the man , the psychedelic <unk> with the discovery of the magic fungi in mexico in the <unk> years , i started has , about being discussed . i said , that you <unk> not as highly hallucinogenic categorize it was okay , a moment , in the you look at the effects of , you . there is , to a <unk> to experience .
but the thing with <unk> is that is , they do n't orally that , you can be , because you through a in the human gut , <unk> on with names <unk> , <unk> .
they can only in the connection with some of different chemicals , orally that , you 're going , the mao <unk> .
now that 's fascinating , the <unk> , in the <unk> in them are , <unk> of exactly the way that are , that is necessary , to the <unk> to <unk> . questions . so itself .
how can these people from a <unk> by 80,000 kinds <unk> plant these two , morphologically and not related to plant to find that , if this way , combined , a kind of <unk> version of creating , so that the whole greater than the sum of its parts is ?
we use these great euphemism , trial and error , what i mean , as to -- turns out .
but we ask you the native americans tell you , `` the plant is talking to us . ''
so , what that means .
this tribe , the <unk> , i 've got 17 different varieties . <unk> , that they all at great distance in see , the for our eyes , as a kind of things .
and then ask you , how they maintained that taxonomy of see it , and they say , i thought you do something of plants .
i mean , you know anything at all ? '' and i said , `` no . ''
so , it turns to start out , that you any of 17 different varieties , <unk> absolute and they sing to a in a different <unk> .
so , that you to do n't have a ph.d. in the harvard , but it 's more interesting than <unk> to count .
so , that <unk> the problem is , even those of us , the concerns for the hard to the native americans have , you as <unk> and colorful , look , they but somehow the past , one issue , during the world , which our world , progresses .
so , the fact is , you that in the 20th century . , in 300 years , not for his terrorist war or technological innovation will remember , but rather than at an era , in the we <unk> was and the massive destruction of biological and cultural diversity around the earth , either way of support , or becoming passive accept . so this problem is not the change .
all cultures have to , at the dance with new <unk> involved .
and the problem is not the technology .
the <unk> were not less on the sioux refused to be , when you must bow and the arrow did , as the americans who stopped americans to be , when you a horse and <unk> tasks .
do n't change and technology could threaten the integrity of the <unk> . it 's power . that could face the rule .
and where we also , you in the world <unk> , you will discover that these cultures , not the sinking of <unk> . that are non-zero-sum dynamic , and uncontacted peoples , whose existence through the visible very much , that 's the over their capacity of things , we 're going outside . whether it spreading through this to the vast possibilities of deforestation in the country of the <unk> is , a <unk> from asia , of <unk> , a people , that have a generation , in the forest , living , and now to <unk> and prostitution , the river prostrated himself was , from where you can see , that even the river with the mud , polluted water will , the almost half of borneo , in the <unk> sea <unk> seems . of where the japanese <unk> at it to see are , that are willing , their <unk> with the raw <unk> to fill that you the forest away . or how in the case <unk> , where it <unk> are , during the <unk> <unk> .
or if we in the mountains of tibet and go , where i <unk> much on , is that you could face the dominance .
you know , the genocide , that <unk> extinction of people 's kind of the world , but the <unk> , the destruction of the way of the people , is not only has seen in , but generally , and <unk> as part of a <unk> celebrated .
and you can the suffering <unk> n't understand , if you do n't it on <unk> level , you have seen .
and i went even with a young scientist colleagues got 6,000 of miles of <unk> in <unk> <unk> by <unk> to <unk> and only when i 'm going to <unk> came , i saw the face the statistics of you hear . 6,000 holy monuments , the in the rubble , and ash into . 1.2 million people , the during the cultural melting of the <unk> killed .

this meant , that he was during the invasion immediately get killed .
his uncle '' bug living with their sanctity in the diaspora , the people to nepal .
his mother was locked up , than lenient punishment to -- for the crime as wealthy .
he was the age of two years in the prison smuggled , to be wondering , under your <unk> to hide , because they do without it does n't live .
the sister , that these <unk> fact , rent from , was in a <unk> to the country .
one day i could make them out on them on a tags mentioned , and for those <unk> had them for seven years in a heavy , labor .
the suffering <unk> can become intolerable be , but the <unk> spirit of people 's something <unk> .
and the end up , that we really have a choice . we want in a <unk> world of <unk> or in a <unk> world of diversity of life ?
margaret mead , the great . anthropologist who said before they died , that 's their greatest fear is , while we 're in towards a thread , <unk> , compounds and at the world move , we 're not just the whole range of human imagination , in a <unk> way down would see , but that one day we made of a dream up , and i 've forgotten , that 's one of any other possibilities that there .
and it 's really humbling to it to think , that our species , perhaps been over 600,000 years .
the <unk> revolution , giving us the agriculture has got , and us that moment , the cult of <unk> <unk> , the poetry of the shamans live video-feed through the prose the priesthood <unk> and hierarchy , specialization and we created -- i found , just 10,000 years .
the modern industrial world as we know them is hardly see 300 years old .
well , these superficial data in history tells me not , that we all the answers on the challenges have , which we in the next for millennia to stand .
if we have this spread <unk> after the importance of being human questions , the answers you with 10,000 various voices .
and in this song we 're going to the opportunity to rediscover that , to be , what we are , people with being conscious , the , the importance of these are , that all people and gardens , a space , are being able to <unk> to deal . and there 's great moments of the optimism .
here is a picture , that i the north end of <unk> on , when i do with <unk> on the <unk> went . and this man , <unk> , told me a wonderful story of his <unk> .
the tree , government is not always very well with the inuit handle , and during the <unk> years in part of the establishment of the rule , they were forced me , settlements , to .
the grandfather of this old man who refused .
the family , the fear to be life was , i took him all of guns and all the tools .
now you have to know , the inuit -- not afraid , the cold . they used them to their advantage .
the <unk> their <unk> were created originally from fish , the in <unk> wrapped up was , it .
the grandfather of man was wondering , not going on the arctic night , or the <unk> storm .
he <unk> to figure out , it caused his pants off from <unk> and <unk> in his hand . and as the feces to seize that started , shaped , he them in the form of <unk> .
he <unk> saliva and the sides of <unk> and when it are frozen was , <unk> he 's a dog that .

so you come from nothing to do something .
and this is in many ways a symbol for the resistance , the inuit -- and all indigenous on earth .
the canadian , there was the inuit -- in april 1999 , the complete control of an area , that 's bigger than the california , texas .
it 's our new home country , and i mean <unk> .
it 's a completely independent area . they control all <unk> .
an amazing example , as a nation , a state , the atonement with its people , and we can break .
and ultimately , i believe it 's pretty obvious , at least for those of us , the to these distant for the earth , across are , to see is , they do n't get away .
they are the <unk> of someone .
they represent the human imagination , the in times past the way back . and for all of us , are the dreams of those kids , like the dreams of our own children in the geography of hope .
what we at national geographic survey after all trying , is that we believe that politicians ever do anything .
we believe that <unk> -- we believe that <unk> not -- but is , but we believe that storytelling and the world can change and we 're probably the institution for storytelling in the world . our website , 35 million popular ones transmitted every month .
156 nations to send our tv .
our , you will of millions of people reading .
and we are a series of travel in the <unk> , on that we 're looking for our audience to places of such as cultural and wonder with you , that they of you just by . and hopefully , they are no one after another , the central epiphany of physical anthropology on one : that the world 's made this has , on different ways to exist , that we have a <unk> in a really multicultural <unk> world can find them , at the wisdom of all people to our shared and well-being we can contribute .
thank you .
what i first , as fast as possible , you 'll see , is the work , a new technology , that we microsoft , as part of a <unk> ago exactly one year , who have . this is <unk> . and it 's an environment , in the you either the local or take away with huge amounts of visual data can deal .
we see many , gigabytes of digital photographs here , that you would blend seamlessly , and that <unk> , pan , in any way to make arrangements .
and it 's no matter , how many of information we look , how large that collections and we 're or how big the images are .
the most of you 're using digital photos of a camera , but this is for a scan of the hyperbolic , and it 's in one area of 300 <unk> .
it does n't matter , because the only , what the performance of the system , like this is not be constrained can , is the number at a pixel in your screen in every moment . it also has a very flexible , architecture .
this is a whole book , a blueprint for <unk> .
this is <unk> house of <unk> . every tearing is a chapter .
to prove that is really to a text and not to a picture is , we can produce something like that do , to really to show that these an actual representation of <unk> and not an image is .
maybe this is an artificial way , a <unk> to read .
i would it does n't recommend .
this is a <unk> case . this is a copy of the guardian .
every big image is the beginning of <unk> .
and that there you really the pleasure and the good experience a real <unk> a magazine , or a newspaper to read , at a kind of medium with several scales .
we 've also something at the corner of this special edition of the guardian did .
we have a wrong with this is very high , which are designed , the much higher than with a normal this is , and we 've added the content , added .
if you the features of cars to see , they can see here .
or different models , or even a technical <unk> .
and that she really those ideas on , these constraints , there are a place on the screen aimed .
we hope , that we do n't add pop-ups and other nonsense , more mean -- that should n't be necessary .
obviously this is that mapping then one of the really obvious applications for a technology like this .
and i want it 's really not much spend time , except to say , that we also to this area that .
but that are all roads in the united states .
<unk> the top of <unk> picture of the nasa .
you make us now something else out .
this is actually now live in the internet . you can it <unk> .
this is a project with the name <unk> , that really two different technologies together .

and rick <unk> of microsoft , i 've done . a very good working together .
so this is live in the internet . it will of <unk> powered .
you can see that , if we put this kind of views , in which we by images through , can and that experience of his multibillionaire , which is done .
but the spatial can still be the images here is in the fact , of .
the <unk> have these pictures together , lasted so you the real space . this footage , the all in near the <unk> <unk> in the canadian rockies , were made , which are . you see here elements of stabilized slides , or <unk> <unk> and these things were all in perspective in the relationship with myself on .
i do n't know exactly , if i time still have you very different environments to show .
there 's what , the amount of spatial .
i wanted to look straight one of the original pieces of test about showing and this is from an early prototype of <unk> in which we first time in summer 've been working , to that you try to show , what i think , that 's really the kicker is behind this technology , the <unk> is . and this is not so obviously , the environments , that we on the site .
we had to the lawyers , etc . to do .
this is a <unk> the cathedral notre dame , lady , the only in the computer with images from flickr and after . give you just going to notre dame , lady , flickr simply a and they 're taking pictures of men in t-shirts and the <unk> etc . get . each of orange <unk> represents a picture , this as to this model <unk> was discovered .
so they 're this all <unk> , and they all stand in this way in the relationship with each other .
and we can be in this very simple way to navigate .
. you know , i 've never did , that i end up at microsoft work .
i 'm very grateful for the inmates had this .
. i suspect , you can see , that many different kinds of these are , everything is , of the <unk> to professional <unk> , a pretty large number of them , the all in this environment patched me .
and when they can , i 'm going to some of weird to find .
a lot of you 're of their faces , with , etc .
somewhere here are a series of photographs -- here are you .
this is actually a poster of notre dame , lady , the right recorded by the world .
we can of the poster to a physical view this environment and change .
the point is here , that we do things with the social environment can do . it will now data from all gathered together -- of the whole collective of memory of them , like , visually , the planet looks -- and everything is going to each other .
all these photographs are going to each other , and it is something , that 's bigger than the sum of the parts .
they get a model , that from around the earth is .
at them that as the sequel of labor of stephen <unk> at the virtual earth .
and this is something , that through the complexity , with the people use it , and to use for the user , with the application , is getting bigger .
their own photos are going to have metadata <unk> , the one another person on .
if we have to anyone in the trouble has done and all those with them , and becomes , who you 're all , and it 's my photo of the notre <unk> suddenly , with all that data , held and i can you want to start using the in this space to come , in this <unk> , the photos of the other people use and a kind of <unk> <unk> social experience with the use of other players doing .
and of course , the byproduct of all of the people are immense , ranging from the virtual models of any interesting part of the ground , the not just by <unk> or a satellite and so on the were , but through collective of memory .
thank you .
. i do you right ? their software to , that to look at a certain , within the next few years , all images , the of someone in the world together to be used in principle , one another linked to be ?
yes . she does not different than to explore .
you want me , made them to hyperlinks , between the slides .
and they do this based on the content in the slides .
and this is really exciting , you look at the amount of semantic information i think , the most of images have .
as if you a <unk> for images make , where they got your and the text , the site itself contains a lot of information about , which is think that 's .
but what about it , if this picture them with all their pictures of the reason ?
then is the circumference of the semantic <unk> and the amount , the way . it basically , really enormous . it 's a classic <unk> .
<unk> , this is really incredible , congratulations .
they have much .
i 'll tell you some things from my book about the , i hope , in unison with other things are the they have heard . and i 'm trying to myself a couple of connections to design , if you this is n't have noticed there are .
i want to start , what i call `` the official dogma binding . '' i call .
the official dogma of what ?
the official <unk> of any western industrialized societies .
the official dogma in it 's so , if our goal of this to maximize coverage of the common of citizen 's , about this , through the <unk> the freedom of individuals .
the reason for this is , liberty in to itself is good , valuable , make sense , a <unk> principal requirement for the human .
when people freedom to have , about each of us to to itself to the things to do , the our public good to maximize and nobody has to us to decide .
the freedom to maximize that 's a choice to maximize returns .
the more choices , people have , more and more of freedom to have you . and the more of freedom that they have , more and more common good have you .
this is , i think so deeply in our water , ones , that 's not in the point i was coming it to ask questions .
and it 's also deeply in our lives , an environment .
i 'll tell you some examples of that there , which gives us modern and had to take place .
this is my supermarket . not a big .
i just something about <unk> say .

so this is , like the supermarket .
and they go to the <unk> business plan to a good stereo at an -- some speakers , <unk> , a <unk> , radio , it 's imagination-amplifier . and in this one of electronics in , there 's so many <unk> facilities .
we can <unk> millions of <unk> reason why i put out of the components , the in a business was offered .
they must admit , that a large selection is .
in other areas -- the world of communication .
there 's a time , when i a boy was , because you could every phone , hosts have the you wanted , unless it from an ma bell was .
they have your phone <unk> . they have n't it <unk>
a consequence of it was that , the phone ever broken .
these days are over .
we 've now almost an infinite , choice . their telephones , especially in the world of mobile phones .
that are the mobile phones , the future .
my favorite is in the middle -- <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> torch around .
and they should be that , still not in your business have seen , you can be safe , you to it soon .
and what it does it 's going to help people to in the business to walk and this question is to start .
you know now what the answer that question is ?
the answer is said no .
it 's not possible a cellphone , to buy , that 's not to be much does .
in other aspects of life , the very much more important than that buy one of objects are , hit the same explosion of choice .
health -- it 's not known for the case in the united states that you for you go and the doctor says you what to do .
instead , they 're going to the doctor and the doctor says you , if we created a to make or we could call b .
a , has these benefits and risks .
b has these benefits and risks . what you want to do ?
and they say , `` doctor , so what i do ? ''
the doctor says , a , has these benefits and risks and b has those benefits and risks .
what you want to do ?
and if you say , `` if you i would be , you know , what would you do ? ''
the doctor says , `` but i 'm not you . ''
the result is -- we call it `` patient , autonomy . '' this sounds like a good thing , but in the reality is a shift the burden of responsibility for the meeting of decisions of someone , that you know -- namely the doctor -- to the n't know , and more tomorrow 's ill and why not in the best constitution , is a choice to meet -- namely the patient .

why do n't advertise on them to us , if we 're not able to buy ?
the answer is , they sort of us the doctor across the next morning to call and to a change of prescription to ask .
something so profound as our identity is now a question of choice , like this slide to demonstrate .
we 'd not an identity , we make them .
and we make us so often to examine how we want .
that is , that every day , if you the morning everybody waking up , they need to make , for a kind of person you could be really want .
in terms of marriage and family , there 's a time , in the <unk> was that , almost every one had and that you so fast , married soon as you could , and so children got , as you could .
the only true that election was `` who '' , not any day , and not what they then we did .
nowadays everything is easy .
i teach at the intelligent , students , and i leave you 20 percent less at work as i did indeed .
and that 's not because they 're less sense are , and not because they 're less carefully .
it 's because you with other things too are , you ask yourself to myself , `` i have to marry , or not ? should i now , marry ?
i later , marry ? should i just have kids , or just career making ? ''
that are all <unk> questions .
and they 're going to answer those questions , regardless of them , if that 's all mean that in to do that i do you bullied , and no good note in my class , to get .
and in the fact , and you should do this . that are important to <unk> questions .
work -- we 're blessed , as carl sort has , with the technology that allows us every minute of every day of any place on the planet to work -- until the <unk> hotel .
there 's actually a corner , of the i did n't tell me , at the <unk> works .
i 'm going to it does n't tell you , because i use it wants .
so what it , this incredible freedom of choice we have in terms of choices to meet , and again , and again , whether we have to work or not have to work .
we can make our kids in the football games could n't look , and we have our mobile phone , a hip , and our blackberry , at the other hip , and our laptop probably going on our lap .
and also if you all off are , every minute , in the we our child , <unk> of a soccer never ask , we also , `` i tried to this call would ?
i should be in this email somebody answers ? i tried to this letter writing ? ''
and also if the answer to the question `` no , '' is it certainly in your experience of <unk> their children 's , cloaking them very different than it would have been .
everywhere , where we look , great things and little things , material things and lifestyle , life is a question of choice .
and the world in the we lived looked like this .
so i want to say , there 's some of choices , but not it was a question of choice .
and the world in the now we live looks like this .
and the question is , are the good news or bad ?
the answer is yes .
we all know what good about this is , so i 'm about what 's bad about this is .
all these choices we have two effects , two or negative effects on people .
a venturi effect , <unk> way , is , he paralyzed , instead to be free .
with so many options out of the you pick it , it people very hard to do need to decide .
i 'm going to a another <unk> to give , a study about investing in private voluntary <unk> .
a colleague from me had access in <unk> of <unk> , the giant <unk> of a million u.s. employees and i think about . 2,000 people different jobs .
and what they found was a 10 <unk> the of employers who offered it , i took the great to two percent .
they 're offering 50 <unk> to -- 10 percent fewer people taking part of as if you just five to be . why ?
because it 50 <unk> are , the selection are , it 's hard to decide what you choose to which is , they it on the morning , the boxes .
and then tomorrow , and then tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow 's obviously never .
you know , that 's not just mean , that people <unk> to eat , if you in the retirement . go , because they 're not enough money for them on , have , it means also , that you 'll make this hard is , they big <unk> her employer on .
by the not participating in the give them to around the u.s. dollars per year on a lot of the future employer , the happy that would have been their contributions to reproduce .
paralysis , is a consequence of to many options .
and i think it it makes , the world looks like this .
they like the decision really , if it for all eternity is , right ?
they do n't want the wrong investment fund to vote , or even the <unk> .
so this is the an effect . the other side effect is , even if we the lesion that and make a decision , we end we have less happy with the result of the selection , as , if we have the possibility of out of us between the less ways to decide .
and there 's several reasons for this .
one of them is reduced by the large selection of <unk> , if you buy one , and it 's not perfect -- and , which <unk> 's been perfect imitation ? it 's easy to imagine , that they have a different decision like you can meet the better would have been . and what happens is this rough metaphor i 've come up an alternative which leads to , you to the decision to regret , and this five regrets of stacked against the average happiness , that you some of their impacts are that had , if it 's a good choice .
the more opportunities there 's , more and which is it does nothing to regret that 's a letdown . for the choice that they meet .
secondly , what economists <unk> .
dan , gilbert , has a big point the morning is made by he told as a very , the way in the we evaluate things , it depends on to what we it 's compare .
well , if it 's very many of alternatives to think there , it 's easy . attractive of one of alternatives , that they exclude , that makes them less happy with the alternatives , that they voted .
here 's an example . for the of them , the no new york are , sorry i .
but here is , what they 're thinking about to .
here 's a couple of the hamptons .
very expensive real estate .
gorgeous embodiment of the beach . great day . they have it all for themselves .
what could be better ? `` damn ! '' the man who thinks , `` it 's an august .
everybody in my <unk> neighborhood that 's gone .
i could directly in my house park . ''
and he spend two weeks of the thought of that he is the possibility of missed it has , day about the day , a great parking lot more .
<unk> reduce the average happiness , that we by our choice and get , as well , if that what we think you 've been fantastic .
and the more ways it on the choice , there , more and more attractive properties of choices be in the <unk> consideration .
here 's another example .
now , this cartoon is doing some statements .
he makes a statement about the right now to live , and perhaps about things are slow to do .
but a very important point , he does is : you look , who do for one thing to decide , and they have to other things not to do .
and these other things like many , attractive properties have , and it will , what they do n't be less motivator .
three : <unk> the expectation .
this has i met , when i mean for me to exchange .
i 'm dressed me , almost all the time .
and there 's a time in the it just for me a way that there , and they have you bought , and you have a bad <unk> , they were incredibly <unk> and if you long enough by and often enough clean had , you have started wondering , `` ok . '' <unk> .
so i went to new me to buy after many years of <unk> the old , and i said , `` i 'd like a few jeans , here 's my size . ''
and the guy said , `` you want to risk , <unk> or a vast sea ?
you want to do buttons , or <unk> ? rock or an acid would clean ?
you want to me with holes ?
want them down a papercutting , <unk> , blah ... '' and so he told .
my jaw was down and after i started rebounding , i said , `` i 'd like the way , the early in the only way . ''
he had no idea what that was , so i spent an hour with all these up and jeans <unk> , and spread the business -- and i say the truth -- with the best put me , that i ever did .
i did it better . all these choices that allowed it me it better .
but i felt bad .
why ? i wrote a whole book , to try it to myself to understand .
the reason for , that i got worse , i felt was , with all that we have opportunities , and expectations of this , which for a few jeans is , went up .
i had very low expectations . i was n't let 's expectations , as it you just in a kind of there .
when you in a hundred species that came , damn well , one of you have quite there are to be ,
and what i got was good , but it was n't perfect .
and so i was i what i have had to the what i expected , and what i do was a letdown . in comparison to the what i expected .
this add some of opportunities in the life people increases is the expectations of the people have about how well these opportunities to be .
and this gets to less great satisfaction with the results , the results are good .
nobody in the world of marketing manager knows that . because , if you it would say , you know what they all do n't comprehend what it 's the humans .
the truth is more like this .
the reason is , that used everything was better than anything worse , was , than anything worse , was , it was for the people can see these things to make the a surprise .
now , in the world in the we live -- we 're wealthy , one thing that citizens , perfection arises when i went -- the best for that you ever greater hope it 's the things that are good as you do it of you expect .
they 'll never let 's surprised . because your expectations , and expectations , <unk> .
the secret to the conditions -- that 's what they all came out there are -- the secret to the conditions are , have an expectation .
i want to say -- a <unk> moment -- that i do with a wife annie perasa married , i am , and they really is very beautiful .
i 'd let 's not better . i did not culturing .
but they preferred 's not always like a bad thing .
finally , a consequence of <unk> one thing sitting right for me if it only one way to buy there is , if you with these are , and they 're wondering why , who is responsible , the answer is clear . the world is responsible . what would you can do ?
if hundreds of different kinds of me are available , and they buy one of anticlimactic is , and they 're wondering why , who 's in ?
it 's also , that the answer to the question is , you .
they have it better .
with a hundred different kinds of me to the windows , there 's no excuse for error .
and so , when people make decisions , if you the results make decisions are good , feel you try to be disappointed about , they actually to themselves .
clinical depression , exploded in the industrial world in the past generation .
i think a pretty whopping -- not the only , but a pretty whopping <unk> to this explosion of depression , and also the suicide , is , who 've learned that a letdown . you know , because their standards , so high . and then , if you try to these experiences , even tell you have , you think it would your fault .
and so that 's <unk> , that it 's generally better go , objective , and we 're bad feeling .
so let me take you remember .
this is the official dogma , this one that we all for really think , completely wrong . it 's not true .
there 's no question , that a choice is better than any weakness , but it is not , that more selection is better than a choice .
there 's a magical lot . i do n't know what it 's .
i 'm pretty sure , that we need to that long you have to the variety of our public good way .
now , as a policy question -- i am almost finished -- as a policy question , the thing about the thinking about . that what these are choosing to be sitting in the industrialized societies , is the material that wealth .
there 's many places in the world , and we have of many of you heard , the problem is not the world to a large selection is .
your issue is , you to little bit .
so the things about that i 'm telling you 're an odd thing with the modern , rich , that of societies .
and what is so incredibly frustrating and on is : steve levitt , you briefly yesterday about talks about how this is more expensive and hard to <unk> <unk> n't help . it 's a waste of money .
what i 'm telling you is , that this very expensive , complicated patient making -- it 's not easy , that they do n't help .
they 're actually hurt .
they worry that we got worse , standing there .
if something of what the people in our society that allows this big decisions , to come to the societies in which people to a choice , if you 've shifted that , not just the life people struggling , but we would also be improved .
economists call this one <unk> amazed .
<unk> going to worry that , in getting better about -- not just the poor -- because all these large selection of us an educational .
finally , read you to this cartoon , and , a sophisticated person , says , `` ah ! what do this fish ?
you know it not possible in this <unk> . ''
<unk> imagination , a shortsighted of the world -- and that 's about the way i 's going to read .
the more , i thought about , more and more i came to the view , that the fish , that you know .
because the truth is , if you that <unk> break , so that everything is possible , they have no freedom . they have a lesion .
if you that <unk> break , so that everything is possible , to take them the average happiness .
they raise that paralysis and reduce the average happiness .
everyone needs a <unk> .
this is almost to of complete security to be limited -- possibly also for the fish , definitely upward for us .
but that <unk> be from a metaphorical <unk> is a recipe for children , and , i suspect , disaster .
thank you very much .
you know , i talked about some of these projects are already been talking , about the human genome and what that could mean , and over the discovery of groups of genes .
actually start , we of a new point , we have the biology and digitized , and now we try the digital code in a new phase of biology to get by we new life create , and build .
we 've always trying to great questions to imagine .
what 's life ? it 's something , what i think , that many biologists have tried to understand and this in a different levels .
we have different approaches tried to it until the minimum of the components to simplify them .
we have nearly 20 years of digitized . when we that <unk> have sequenced it was wondering , the transition from the analog world of biology to digital world the computer .
now we 're trying to ask , whether we live you what can or whether we new life create , from this digital universe ?
this is the map of a small organism , the mycoplasma <unk> , the smallest genome of species has the to itself in there are self-replicating . and we 've tried to see if we that with a still getting smaller genome that can .
we 've done it on about a hundred genes to get rid of the 500 , or so , the here are .
but if we those metabolic you look , the very simple is , in comparison to our own . you can trust me , that 's too . but if we all those genes , watch that we one after another , eliminate can it 's very unlikely that this to a living cell to be .
so we 've decided that , the only way to jump forward is that chromosome in order to synthesize , which allows us the components of components to <unk> and some of the fundamental question is to start .
and so we started working on with the question , we can a chromosome , synthesize that ?
what it 's the chemistry of these really big nano-molecular molecules to build this is still never been done before ?
and , if we can do that , we can that chromosome start ?
a chromosome , is that way , just a piece <unk> where fissionable material .
our first steps at the digitization , of life were growing exponentially .
our ability of genetic code to have to very slowly developed , but to place . and our final point was now on an exponential curve to prioritize .
we 've got 15 years ago i started doing this .
it actually a few years , starting with a <unk> review , before we the first experiments , and did .
how to start out there 's <unk> hard .
there 's tens of machines are around to the world 's the little pieces of dna to be able , 30 to 50 of long , but it 's a <unk> process , so the longer you a piece of power , the more error happen .
so we had a new way to come up with the we these little pieces together and the error correct could .
this was our first attempt , starting with the digital information , of the genome phi x 174 countries .
it 's just a virus that the bacteria , kill .
we started small pieces , did a <unk> and had a dna molecule of about 5,000 letters .
the interesting ; it came when we this piece <unk> we took and in a bacterium , and that bacteria and the genetic code to read and they made a viral particles .
the viral advertisement of them were then of the cells were opened up and they came back and killed , e. coli .
recently i did with the <unk> , and they said that you this model just figure out .
they were laughing , more than her , it 's doing .
so we think that 's a situation is in the software in fact that your hardware we can build in a biological system .
but we wanted to still a lot to go further . we want a whole <unk> chromosome ; building . it has more than <unk> of genetic code . so we thought , we build it in it on the size of the virus , what we need the size it <unk> were able to understand what the components of components of living cell .
design is the key , and if you with digital information in a computer will just want to these digital access information , really all accurate .
when we the genome for the first in 1995 , have sequenced it was the <unk> at a mistake per 10,000 base pairs .
we found the <unk> 30 mistakes . if we the original sequence that used to have it would never been possible <unk> .
a part of it 's , and we chose to the 50 letters for are and the with other <unk> pieces overlap . have the smaller <unk> to build with these together .
we have a unique and here into .
you might have heard that we <unk> into space .
you think about it for instance , we have a <unk> code , a , c , g and t .
<unk> these letters -- these letters actually encode about 20 amino ; and there 's a single , what matters for each of amino acids .
so we can the genetic code using about our words to write , sentences , thoughts .
and then we 've only signed .
so many people who was disappointed about that 's no new poetry was .
we have the pieces that 's that we just want you with what enzymes , though they could . it there are enzymes are the this repair and to stitch back .
and we 've started , and how to design , starting with pieces of the five to <unk> letters in terms , added these people to <unk> to try to this back into , to <unk> .
in every step , we have these pieces in the surplus , is able to `` you 're sequencing ; they could , because we tried to a very robust process to create what they were in a minute going to see .
we 've tried to point of <unk> to get there .
so , that looks out how a <unk> .
if we need to these really great happiness spontaneously rises to get -- with over 100,000 pair of -- then we are these are not just in the chuck e. coli . it adds up all possibilities of modern molecular biology . and so well , we other policy mechanisms to .
we knew from a mechanism of <unk> recombinations to call this is , the biology is used to disrupt dna to repair that these pieces together .
here 's an example of them . there 's one organism function called <unk> <unk> the three million , look at the fine .
you see the top of the field , to be a chromosome , just cut down .
to about 12 , 24 hours later , has to everything again , so uneasily together as it was .
we have thousands of organisms that can do that .
these organisms that can totally <unk> be , you can even in a vacuum .
i 'm absolutely certain that live in space there , and moving . can , the quest for <unk> conditions .
indeed , the nasa has shown that 's a lot of them out there are .
here 's a <unk> of the molecule that we 've created by we these things have used -- actually , we 've just <unk> used to the right design the pieces we have you <unk> . yeast and so these then automatically .
this is not <unk> it 's a regular micrograph .
it 's a big molecule , that we do it even with the <unk> can see .
that are pictures of a whole duration of six seconds .

that are about <unk> letters , at hiding the code . it 's the largest molecule , <unk> structure that ever of people who was created .
it has a <unk> of over 300 million .
if we a <unk> of 10 and without the distances of print one would it would <unk> sides to embrace , just to this genetic code <unk> .
now , how will we have a chromosome 7 ? how we activate it ?
obviously is , it with a virus , very simple . it is more with bacteria to deal .
it 's also considerably easier if you know it in <unk> how we it are doing , you just take the nucleus out and there is a different in , and that 's exactly what they all about this is cloning , about .
in <unk> is that chromosome in the cell has but recently , we 've shown that you have a complete transplant of a pair chromosome from one cell to another that can make and these are .
we were cleaning the chromosome one <unk> . speaking , are these two as far from one of how people and the mice . we gave some <unk> and so we have that chromosome , select group were . we <unk> it with what enzymes are committed to all these proteins to destroy , and it was very amazing when we did it in a cell , gave -- and they 're going to our very <unk> graphics and here we estimate --
this new synthetic chromosome in to the cell .
in fact , we thought , that 's the end is , but we 've tried to the process that there are going to earth .
this is the <unk> the evolution , here .
we find all kinds of species here the a second , the chromosome in order to have or a third of <unk> , every time thousands of the characteristics , just a second to a species <unk> .
people , the the evolution can imagine that as a gene that 's going to a moment changed will have a lot of the biology , again .
there 's enzymes are the <unk> be called the fact , dna and digest .
that chromosome out that in the cell was has n't ; the chromosomes -- that we put them have been .

it <unk> the blue , because of the genes that we put them .

all these proteins and changed , the membranes and changed . '' -- when we the genetic code , read , it was that 's exactly what we sought to have .
it may sound like the genomic <unk> sound , but we can , we the <unk> here , things quite dramatic change .
now i argues , this is not the <unk> is -- this is based on 3.5 billion years of evolution .
and i argues that we possibly do that are a new form of the cambrian explosion to create in the it 's massive whole new <unk> based on this digital media design that there might .
why should we do that ?
i think it 's pretty obvious in terms of what we need .
we 're doing that of six to nine billion people in the next 40 years <unk> .
to it in my relationship to ask : i was in 1946 , born .
today are three people on this planet for each of , in 1946 , it has ; within of 40 years will it 's four .
we have problems with food , with all-natural fresh and clean water , medicine , fuel for six billion people .
it 's a challenge that for nine to offer .
we need about five billion tons of coal , <unk> billion for every oil . that are a hundred million every day of .
if we of biological processes are thinking or any of the process to bring that replace , it becomes a huge challenge .
then , there 's the co2 from this material that in the end up .
we 've now , from our discoveries from around the world , a database , about 20 million of genes , and i want to believe in it that the <unk> the future .
the <unk> had a dozen components and you see , the diversity of the came out of it .
we hit here in the first line at the limits the biological reality and at those , our imagination .
we 've now technologies of these rapid <unk> , to do that what we <unk> genetics .
we 've now the possibility of a robot to build the millions of chromosomes , the day can create .
if you try to imagine those 20 million of genes to make or these redundant processes to optimize them to octane make or drugs new vaccines , we can do with a just small team more of molecular way as the last 20 years of science .
and it 's just <unk> selection . we 're able to <unk> <unk> , production of chemicals , or <unk> <unk> and so forth .
this is a shot of that 's <unk> , we work , with the you actually sit down and new species on the computer to design <unk>
you know , we could n't necessarily as it will look . we know exactly how their genetic code looks like this is .
what we are now on fuels the fourth generation .
they have recently , corn to run ethanol seen what 's just a bad tv experiment .
we have fuels the <unk> and third generation of the relatively soon as if you 're going to the much higher <unk> will have , octane fuel or different kinds of <unk> .
but , how we think , the only way to biology is a big impact , another spike in the cost on food or the disappointment of of disposability is going to have is , if we co2 as starting material can see , and therefore we 're working at cells that to go ,
and we think that we the first with <unk> the fourth generation will be , and that in about 18 months .
the sunlight and co2 we 're a method --
but -- in our discovery of the world , we 've got all kinds of different ways .
this is an organism , we 1996 , described .
he lives in the deep , about <unk> miles deep , at virtually <unk> <unk> .
it into carbon dioxide in the methane to under the use of hydrogen as energy .

within a short four-year time , we think , we could in the be able to one of basic questions of life to solve .
you know , we 've really -- <unk> goals , like the fine substitute the petrochemical industry . exactly what if you that 's not at ted i could do , where else ? a <unk> the energy .
but as we 're now , it 's the same two approaches to the evolution of vaccines to use .
they have it this year with the flu , seen , we 're always a year , back off and have a dollar to get out of the subject of the right vaccine that goes .
so , i think that changed can be affected by showing you <unk> vaccines , have sufficient .
this is it , like the future , possibly could look to change , can now the <unk> up to be with synthetic one bacteria , <unk> , and maybe <unk> .
we are light years of them from people to improve . our goal is it just , that we have a chance long enough to survive to that potentially to do . thank you .
in the last ted conference , there i an introduction to the lhc .
and i promised to get back , to explain how the machine works .
now , it 's so here . and for all those that did n't there were , the lhc is the biggest increase science experiment , which you ever been approached by -- 27 % of kilometers in diameter .
its task is it , the conditions to create , which fewer than a <unk> second , after the beginning of the universe that existed -- and that to 600 million times within a second .
it 's just let me very poor .
this is the machine , but of geneva .
we take pictures of <unk> in the detectors on .
at this , i work . he calls to an atlas off the detector , of feet in the width , 22 feet in diameter .
here 's a spectacular picture of reference atlas off in the construction , so you the scale .
10th , . september the last year off the machine for the first time .
and this picture was of reference atlas of taken .
it was making huge <unk> in control room .
it 's a picture of the first <unk> which the route to the lhc <unk> , you 're going to make a part of the lhc <unk> , to a rain from the particles in the detector <unk> .
in other words , when we took this 10th , . september they saw , we knew , that this machine works , what a huge victory .
i do n't know , whether this the biggest <unk> generated , or this , when someone the google , i went and the front page that i found was .
it means that we have a cultural shortcomings of the science of trade .
about a week later , there 's a problem with the machine that with these <unk> here to do was -- this golden wires , here .
those wires , run <unk> <unk> when the machine on <unk> .
now , the engineers of you will you look at and say , `` no , that they do n't . that are small wires . ''
you can that contribute , because if you very far cooling , they going to call <unk> .
at minus <unk> degrees , cooler than the space between the stars , can make those wires in the tension , endurance .
in the connections , and piles of <unk> magnet inside the lhc , there 's a <unk> .
so heat , the wires are and <unk> <unk> , out of <unk> resistance .
this was the outcome .
now , all this is still a wonderful when you imagine , that the magnets used over 20 tons weigh , and wondering , to about . 30 inches else .
we were so about 50 the magnet
and they had to remove , what we also did .
we <unk> it , <unk> you .
you , they 're all over again on its way back .
against the march , is the lhc switches back <unk> be .
we 're going to him turn , and expect the first data in june , or maybe july , we 're able to change , and put our journey on , to see what the building blocks of the universe .
now , in a way to stir some of these accidents , again , the debate to extract value of the science and <unk> at such planetary boundaries . it 's easy , that it .
i think the fact , that it 's very difficult , the fact , that we about our planetary boundaries , at the grasp , is perceived value of the things like the lhc .
i 'm going to my final element of words in english scientist to their own . humphrey <unk> , the , as i believe , when he was the most useless experiments of his <unk> defended itself , his student was michael <unk> , what she said , `` nothing is that dangerous for the evolution of the human spirit , when i assume that our scientific ideas on are , that 's no mysteries in the nature , there , that our triumphs <unk> are , and that 's no new worlds to seize that there . ''
thank you .
i 'm a writer .
to write books is my profession , but it 's natural more than that .
it 's also my big , lifetime of love and fascination .
and i do n't expect , that the ever change .
but it 's recent something weird in my life and my career start to that helped me that has brought , my to this work , to rethink .
this to what happened was that , i recently wrote a book , to have -- a biography called <unk> , <unk> , <unk> -- , that , decided to different than all my previous books from that for some in the world beyond and a <unk> , international <unk> .
the result is , i , matter where i come , they 'll as if i the sinking of <unk> .
seriously -- the sinking of <unk> .
for example , you very concerned , on me to and say , if you are not , that they succeeded never by going ?
they have no of it is , they all their lives <unk> and never again a book , create , that anybody in the world wants to know ? never again ? ''
okay , that makes it turns out .
it would rather , even worse , when i 'm not remember this would , that i over 20 years ago , when i a teenager 's the first time of them told , that i writer , who wanted to be , with the same kind of <unk> always been faced am .
the people said , were you do n't afraid , never been to have ?
you ai n't afraid , that you the humiliation of rejection killing ?
you ai n't afraid , you to this for craft , your life for <unk> and it never knew that comes and that you 're going on a <unk> <unk> dreams are going -- your mouth with the bitter dregs of ash of failure to get ?
so roughly , you know .
the answer -- the short answer on these questions is : <unk>
yes , i 'm scared , all those things .
and that i had always .
and i was still much more things , that no <unk> would .
like this -- and other <unk> things .

this is about ?
it 's logical , that of someone to be , that he of it has , the work to do to the he said we have to get you feel ?
and what exactly the creative , there was going on , you to us into uncertainty about the other immersed in making -- in a way , it other professions have n't do ?
my father , for example , was a chemist , and i can look at me any situation in its own 40 years as a chemist who remember , in the he was asked , if he afraid to have , chemist .
with your <unk> , john -- how it away from you that ?
it was just not , you know ?
but to be fair -- the group of the chemist who have over the centuries , not the reputation of <unk> morph from people still .
we who seem , but this kind of the reputation . but not just the writer , but the huge dearth of genres , like this call to have , mentally transporting it 's unstable .
everything , you have to do , is actually , the bitter <unk> of really great minds from just the in the 20th century . to watch , the young and a lot of their own hand , died .
and even the ones , the n't actually <unk> <unk> , the tracks from their talents to actually used to have been .
norman <unk> said , quickly , he died in his last job interview , <unk> my books , has made me a little further <unk>
an extraordinary thing , that you about her life .
but we shrug our n't even , if we find somebody like that you hear , because we put this kind of which has been so long time you know . somehow we have the notion that level and offers to be accepted , that creativity and tired of course <unk> and that art -- the end -- always going to <unk> the it .
the question today , i wish everyone here to ask you want is : is this idea for them totally fine , ?
you feel , comfortable with ? because with only one inch by looking at -- i feel with this notion , do not comfortable .
i think they become really .
and i think they 're dangerous . and i do n't want to watch , how they 're entering the next century , taken .
i think it 's better , if we asked of creative encourage on .
and i know definitely , that it for me -- in the situation -- very dangerous to be , we start , this dark path of things will sort <unk> -- especially in the fact , in the time i was in my career at , i am .
that means -- you see , i 'm pretty well . i 'm only about . 40 years old .
i may yet another 40 <unk> in me .
and it 's extremely likely , that everything , what i went from now at going to write out of the world as the work they will , the after the <unk> success of my last book came , right ?
i say it straightforward , because we 're here , now all of friends -- it 's most likely that my greatest and behind me is .
oh , jesus , which for a thought !
these are the kind of thoughts , that somebody to be able to 9 a.m morning to start , <unk> to drink . and that i want to do n't .
i 'd rather ] to this work to do , that i love .
so is the question : how ?
eventually , of <unk> seem to me , that i , to continue to write to be able , a kind of <unk> psychological ones are design must .
somehow i have to from now to find a way , the can write a safe distance to real disjunction between me and my very natural <unk> about , like the reaction in that 's not be that .
while i was in the last year after the models for looking to have , to do this , i also in the past , looking for and i tried , other societies have to find , to see , if you might better or <unk> ideas about it did when we , how to creative can help , with the emotional risks to deal , the to creativity are connected .
this quest to me into the ancient greece and the ancient rome .
please , you me , because the bubble will be wondering , again , close .
but in ancient greece and rome have the people did n't believe that creativity of people coming , okay ?
they thought , that creativity is a kind <unk> <unk> was , the from a distant , when the source to the people coming -- from <unk> , who reasons .
the greeks called this comes down <unk> of creativity <unk> .
from socrates is known , that he did it was , he had one <unk> , the face it wisdom of further away in which .
the roman had the same idea , called this kind of <unk> creative spirit of a <unk> .
this is great . the roman and we were n't really , that a genius , a very clever which was .
they thought , that a genius with this magical divine , being was that we did was that , literally in the walls of <unk> lives -- it 's about how <unk> , the <unk> -- the <unk> and the artists in the work that kind of the invisible <unk> and the result of design would .
that 's brilliant , there is it , there 's the distance , of the i talked about -- the psychological ideas are , that you of the following your work to protect .
and everybody knew , that it worked , right ?
the artists of <unk> was a certain things are protected , like , for example , to a lot <unk> , right ?
if your work , brilliant , was to sell outs , and you do anything you look for you deduct . everybody knew , you to this <unk> genius did , that you really helpful .
if your work <unk> -- not entirely , your mistakes , right ?
everybody knew , your genius , was something <unk> .
so we have people in the west , really long time about creativity , while .
and then the renaissance and all changed . we had this great idea . and this great idea was , let us the human individual attains the center of the universe , imagine -- about all the gods and mystery . and there 's no room , more for the unicorn , warmth-requiring creatures , the orders of divinity .
it 's the dawn of rational idea of humanism , and the people started to think , that creativity is completely off the own individual needs came .
the first time in the story , you hear you people , or some of artists , a genius call -- instead of them , that he 's a genius .
i must tell you : i think , that was a big mistake .
you know ? i think , one was given person to allow , that he thinks , he or she was like that go , like the pelvis and the essence , and the source of divinity , creative , with unknown , an mystery is a little to a lot of responsibility , to you a <unk> , human psyche , even more .
it 's how someone to ask , the sun to swallow .
that by napalm , and so all your ego and it 's all these <unk> what we went on the success .
so , i think that <unk> our artists , the last 500 years out .
and , , on that -- and i think , it 's true -- is the question :
we change ?
maybe to scuba suits understanding of the relationship between humans and the mystery of creative and return .
maybe not .
maybe we can that <unk> from 500 years of rational idea of humanism , not just in a <unk> talk , the chance .
and there 's certainly affecting people in this audience , the really fair science to register to about the idea of -- basically -- <unk> , the people <unk> and <unk> on their projects , etc . how to work .
i 'm probably not all of them on this journey can take away .
but the question i represent , i want it is : why not ?
why not so think about ?
because it as much sense of how do anything other that i heard of have , if it 's about , the absolutely crazy <unk> <unk> of creative process to understand .
a process , the way . -- like everybody knows , the it ever has tried , something to make -- so in other words : well , everyone here -- not always as to behave .
in the fact , it , sometimes really <unk> feel .
i had recently that sort of what did when i the extraordinary american beat poet , <unk> stone , i met , the well over 90 is that , but all their lives for a poet . they told me , that you when the <unk> virginia up out on the fields , working on . they said , they would feel and can hear like a poem written about the landscape on them <unk> .
they said it would like a <unk> move from the air ,
the about this country , they <unk> would .
they felt , if it came , because it would the earth , under their feet , for <unk> them .
you know , that they were in such a minute , just one could do . and this was -- in her words -- <unk> like the <unk> .
they ran out how the devil population for the house while you from this poem that was being . it was only about , that they really fast enough to a piece of paper and a pen to get to , so you it , if it through them <unk> , capture , and the sheet to do .
in another painting was n't you fast enough . they ran and hurried and ran , but they reached the house , and the poem roll through them and you missed it . they said it was going on over country are , and -- how they said -- <unk> another one day poet <unk> .
and then there were these moments -- the part i 'll never forget -- they said , that it moments , there in which they it almost miss .
so , they 're running for the house and for the paper and the poem goes through them and they 're reaching for a pen , right when it through them <unk> and then -- told them -- it was so when i would with their other hand , after that makes them and it to put me .
you five miles the poem by looking at his tail and moved it back in your body and it 's took on this piece of paper .
in these opportunities to come from the poem and equitably and intact and the paper on -- but it backwards -- from last word for the first .
when i think that i heard , i thought this is too scary -- that 's exactly , like my creative process <unk>
this is actually ca n't like my creative process -- i 'm not the channel .
i 'm a <unk> . to work to be able to i every day , the same time to get up and sweats , i struggle and really pretty uncomfortable <unk> .
but even i held in <unk> 've sometimes this thing <unk> .
and i guess , that many of them that 's also have done .
even i had to work or ideas , the from a source of me <unk> , that i really do n't identify .
what is that for a thing ?
and how we step with it in the relationship with no more about our minds to lose , but for us the fact , mental health to balance ?
for me is the living example , how this to be the musician , tom <unk> . i got him a few years ago for a magazine persons .
we talked about this about this . and you know what ? of the time of his life was tom opens the embodiment of that tortured to modern artist , the tried , these <unk> of impulses that in him who were , to control and with them getting along .
but then he was getting older and quiet . he told me , that he 's one day on a <unk> in going to los angeles , drove off . and there would change , everything for him .
he went with high speed as he suddenly a simple patch of a melody , you hear , the , it in my inspirations are often is , for him the feds , it is tangible . and he wants to have them . she is gorgeous . he <unk> then , but he can you ca n't .
he has not a piece of paper , it has n't pen , it has n't tape .
he begins , those old <unk> in him up , like , `` i 'm going to this thing to lose and i 'm coming from this song on forever are .
i 'm not good enough , i do it ''
but rather than in out to come , he heard just on .
he ended up all the insurgent and doing something completely new .
he looked at just in the sky and said , <unk> , you ca n't see , that i actually drive ? ''
<unk> i like from when i could just a song goes down ?
if you really exist want , come to a <unk> at once again , when i 'm going to you care .
if not , <unk> today , somebody else .
go and <unk> leonard <unk>
his whole <unk> has , then we 've changed .
not the work itself . that was to often that dark as jesus , and ever .
but the process and the heavy <unk> , the him around , was salvaged when he was that of a genius , it took , where he 's nothing , when anger turns up and it , there betrayal , where he sort came from . he realized that , not a skilled behavior , <unk> thing had to be .
it was a strange beasts , truly miraculous , bizarre , working there , a kind of conversation and tom , and the alien , <unk> thing , that 's not very tom .
when i do this story about what you have changed it also a bit of the way , i worked and it has made me , even have saved .
this idea that saved me when i in <unk> of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> . i fell in one of dug of doubt in the we all fail , if we need to take something to work and it does n't work . you 've to think , that 's a disaster . this is the worst sketch artist book , that ever was written .
not just bad , but of the bottom of all time .
i started to think , i should this project , just <unk> .
but then i remembered it , like tom , in the free the sky was talking and i tried it .
i was so my view from the manuscript , and spoke to be in towards an empty the corner of a room .
i spoke out loud , `` stop to , you thing , you and i know them , if this book , not brilliant , is that 's not entirely off my fault , is , right ?
because you see , that i do anything , what i , <unk> . i do n't have more than that .
if you get it so much we have to , you got here show up and your of the deal , all .
okay . but , if you do n't do -- you know what , the hell that .
i 'm and writing , because this is my job .
and i want to go to follow protocol , there , that i today for my part of jobs here , scraping
because -- the end it 's how to follow . centuries ago , have to in the deserts <unk> people to <unk> with the sacred and music and music around , the hours away from were -- to <unk> .
this fixed prices were always been great , because the dancer who were highly professional and they were fantastic .
but now and again , very rare , was something special . one of the performer is was actually <unk> .
and i know , that you know , what i mean , because i know , that they all in your life , once that sort of performance , have seen .
it was when i would have the time <unk> and the dancer walks through a doorway to step . he did n't help but when he 's ever has done -- spends 1,000 nights earlier . but all the added to go together .
and very suddenly appeared . he 's not anymore , no longer in human .
he was from within up and of the bottom up and everything is lit up . through a divine , fire .
when that at that happened , we knew that people what that was . they called it at his name .
they put the hands together and began to sing : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , god , god , <unk>
this is god , you know ?
interesting history 's footnote : when the <unk> <unk> cetaceans they brought this centuries-old practice . the sounds , changed , over the centuries of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> to <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , that you still in <unk> and <unk> hear .
if a performer , in spain a <unk> , something magic has done , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , great , <unk> the brain , because it is : a glimpse at the god .
and that 's great , because we need that .
but , the tricky part follows the next morning , if the dancer from ourselves up and realize that , 11 o'clock at a tuesday -- is -- and he did n't no longer a <unk> of god in .
he 's just a premature aging mortal self with <unk> at . and maybe he will never again to these heights level-up .
and perhaps will never again , god 's name out , when he said we have to turn . but what is he then with the rest of his life begin ?
that 's hard .
this is one of <unk> done some of creative life .
but maybe it must not very much as full of the anguish , his hand , you from the beginning to , we did n't have , the most critical aspects of being , of you move it .
if you might just believe that you a loaner are -- by an export source for a <unk> time your life , the world to someone else 's being passed , if you 've done it .
if we start , so think about , changes all this .
so what i began to think , and so i think with safety in the last several months , while i looked at the book , that soon be going -- as the dangerous , appetite , a lot waiting <unk> my <unk> success .
that i 've constantly , even need to say , when i talk about i 'm going , is : i did n't afraid .
do n't be feeling disheartened .
just do your job .
she was going to continue for your contribution , what we also , he may be .
if your job that dance is , i 'm dancing .
if the dumb on , genius , that you , which is , decide , for a moment one , and yet identified by miracles through your effort to show , <unk> ! ''
and if not , i dance , and yet , your dance .
and <unk> ! '' for you , despite all .
i think it and i felt that , we should that teach .
<unk> ! '' for you , despite all , just for , you to the mere human universal love and the <unk> did , that there .
thank you .
thank you .
<unk> .
last year , i these slides just shown to illustrate , the arctic <unk> , the for that in three million years of the size of the bottom of 48 states had to 40 percent down .
but that there 's not too strong enough to the seriousness , this particular problem , there 's not the thickness of ice is .
in a sense , is the arctic <unk> that beating heart of our global <unk> .
they grow in winter and -- in summer .
the next slide , that i 'm going to show , is a <unk> in the last 25 years has happened .
this <unk> is with the red , a .
you see , it 's on the dark to . this is the year by ice in the wintertime ; and it -- in summer .
we called the <unk> , five years old or older , is almost like blood , which from the body , here <unk> .
in 25 years , it from here , here 's gone .
this is a problem , because the warming the frozen reason to the arctic ocean <unk> . it very large amounts of <unk> carbon that there , which , when he <unk> , of microbes have to methane , which is .
comparing with the whole puzzling at <unk> materials in the atmosphere , i could be wondering , this will double , if we have this critical point that cross .
already today <unk> in some and lakes in alaska , methane itself from the water .
professor <unk> walter , the university in alaska , of another task force to another one was lake last winter , across .
wow !
you about it 's good . the question is , how would have to us are powerless .
and a reason is , this enormous amount of heat up with the greenland from the north .
this is a year <unk> .
but the volume , are much bigger than ever .
this is the <unk> river in <unk> greenland .
if you want to know , like the heavens through <unk> up here flows into the ocean .
those rivers , you take a rapid pace .
the other end of the planet , the antarctic , the largest mass on the planet .
last month had signed up , scientists , that the entire continent now a negative <unk> .
and the <unk> , the about a couple <unk> up is , is very strong in the melting .
this is 20 feet above sea level , as in greenland .
in the himalayas , the <unk> mass , you see up new lakes , the a few years ago glacier caves .
40 percent of people in the world get the half of their <unk> from that are draining down .
in the andes , is this glacier , the <unk> for this town .
that washes off have to <unk> .
but if you <unk> , will also the most of water <unk> .
in california was a 40 percent reduction in the <unk> the sierra seen .
this in the <unk> .
and the predictions , as you read have , are seriously .
this <unk> in the world to a dramatic improvement on fire .
and the challenger disaster in the world have in a really <unk> and she 'd never an unprecedented degree gained .
times as many in the last 30 years , like in the <unk> 75 .
this is a completely <unk> <unk> .
if you this in the historical context of yourself , you can see , what it <unk> .
in the last five years , we have 70 million tons of co2 produced , all of 24 hours -- 25 million tons of every day in the oceans .
let you try to the area of the eastern pacific , right , the american continent the west , and both of indian <unk> , where it 's a drastically decline of oxygen in the ocean there .
the largest single factor for the global warming , next to logging , which is 20 percent is , is the burning of fossil fuels .
it 's a problem , and coal is that 's nevertheless biggest problem .
the united states are one or the largest <unk> , along with china .
and the suggestion was , many more <unk> to build .
but we start , a change in .
here are the , the in the last few years , painted by , with some green are alternatives , the design proposed .
<unk> there 's a political engagement in in our country .
and the <unk> and <unk> have a <unk> dollars last <unk> spent , to clean coal to apply , what to try to have a contradiction in , is .
this reminded me at something .
the christmas around them off , at me to home in tennessee , a billion tons <unk> .
they have it <unk> in the news .
this is in our whole country , the <unk> trash in america .
this happened to christmas .
one of the ads , the <unk> to christmas , was this .
<unk> the <unk> is a <unk> , happy -- .
it 's in the shell and wealth in america , and he helps our economy to expand .
<unk> , the <unk> going to every day , clean .
he is affordable , and <unk> , and the workers will remain in wages , and this bread .
this is the source of coal in west virginia .
the most powerful <unk> is the heads of massey coal .
let me give you a very clear to say , al gore , nancy <unk> , harry <unk> , they do n't know , which they talk .
so the alliance for <unk> two leaders will into in '' .
this is one , a part of her .
at the <unk> we see the climate change , as a serious at risk for our business .
so we have it gives us to the top <unk> to actually , a significant <unk> spending to a <unk> on the way to earth , to the truth about coal .
the fact is , coal is not much .
we think , she 's clean -- and it 's also still good .
so , to do n't worry about the climate .
leave you go ahead of us .
<unk> coal , they have a lot about it .
so you make us a tour of modern , clean <unk> do .
fantastic ! this machine is quite loud .
but it 's the sound of clean <unk> .
and yet the burning of coal in the main reasons for the global warming is , the remarkably , clean <unk> , that you see here , changes everything .
you look at it right , this is the world today , clean <unk> .
it ended up to the positive alternative to our economic challenge and our challenge the national security .
america 's in a crisis , the economy , the national security , the climate crisis .
the red thread , of these all together , is our dependence of <unk> <unk> the dirty and coal and <unk> oil .
but now there 's a bold , new solutions , to us from this <unk> able to be free .
<unk> america with 100 percent cleaner , electricity to , within the next 10 years .
a plan , america , back to work to earth , us safer and to do , and to help , the global warming continues to stop .
finally , a solution , the big enough is , our to solve problems .
<unk> america in new . they get more out .
this is the last .
it goes to a <unk> of america .
one of the fastest way , our dependence of the old , and diapers <unk> , the world is on , to reduce .
the future is here . wind , the sun and a new energy system .
new investment , to all right from well-paid jobs to create .
<unk> america in new . it 's time , reality to accept .
there 's an old african health is : `` if you know , you want to be , `` go alone .
if you go to do want to go together . ''
we have far come , which is to quickly .
thank you .
so i want you start to ask , at the time your childhood <unk> , when you with <unk> played .
while they realized , how to the hands out and <unk> , the <unk> pick up and moves , we learned when they actually , to think , and problems through the understanding and change the spatial what 's going to solve .
the spatial can think is closely with being connected spaces , we a lot of our environment to understand .
as a scientist -- inspired by the kind of our interaction with real word objects -- and with my <unk> <unk> and my colleagues <unk> <unk> , i started to be wondering : what would , if we use computers were , that instead of <unk> , the , as a digital <unk> on a very even have dropped it moves -- what would , if we do with both hands were could and data , physically , who and they so , put them could , how we it want ?
this question was so intense , that we need to study of the answer to and <unk> .
short , a <unk> is an interactive computer in the size of <unk> .
you can with the hand may be moved , you can do to each other way , you can her explore motion capture and they have a screen and a <unk> .
more importantly , are physically , why you like blocks are merely by the stick out of hands and access to move .
and the <unk> are an example of a new generation of <unk> to the manipulation of digital data .
and if these tools <unk> going and a consciousness for your movement to actually , each recognize and the intricacies of our <unk> with you see , then we can with the study of new and <unk> <unk> start .
i 'll begin with some simple example .
this <unk> is for the <unk> <unk> and if i asked him in a direction <unk> , is the video . move back ; if i asked him in the other way <unk> , it 's going on it backwards .
and this interactive for portraits , let me , becomes true .
if i say , they immediately co-located horribly , or what that their interest .
if you <unk> are surrounded , we realize you that , and we can see a little nervous .
and they feel as their movements and slope .
an interesting sort of the interactions , that we need to see it started , was that , we sort of the gestures on the data to be , as color so to them into , how this with <unk> does .
with , we have three <unk> as <unk> <unk> and i can use them , to paint in the in the middle to pour , where they then mixed up .
if we it carried , we can a little <unk> .

i 'm here -- that 's a fibonacci numbers , that i do with a simple <unk> draw .
this is a game with words , that a kind of <unk> and <unk> is .
basically , getting each round , every <unk> to <unk> letters and while you 've tried , words to form , are those of a dictionary went through .
then , after about 30 seconds , is back up and you have a new <unk> and new ways to try .
thank you .
that are some kids that on a trip to the media lab , came out . i could you to move , it to try and have a video of taken .
they have it really loved .
a more interesting fact , and this kind of applications is , you the people not a lot of instructions to give you .
everything else you need to say is `` you see words , '' and you know exactly , what to do .
here are still a few people , that 's test .
this is our youngest <unk> down there right .
it turned to start out , that he the <unk> just a pile .
so for him , they were just blocks .
this is an interactive <unk> .
we want a own for <unk> develop .
this is <unk> .
he can see new characters in the scene of them , he the <unk> out of the on , of those figure shows .
here it 's the sun at work .
the sun goes on
now speeding up he 's a <unk> in the scene .
the orange <unk> .
good job ! yeah !
by it 's the <unk> shake and them side , puts it could , the characters are so ...
i brought his own story to invent .
hello !
it 's a story with open up and he can decide , how do these illnesses .
flying his cat .
the last example , for that i now time , to have , it to show , is a <unk> for <unk> , that recently we 've developed and in the <unk> as a sound , <unk> , singing and the drums , they act .
each has four different , you ; you can choose , which you to use .
and you can these sounds in the sequence , putting , that you again in any of pattern of accessing it .
and you <unk> you a transition , you just a <unk> at a <unk> holding .
there are the effects , that you live , we can change , like . hall and filter .
you connect him with a particular sound , and one from him and then to hire .
and then still the overarching effects of the speed and volume , that you on the entire sequence that gets .
so look .
we start , in the way that we <unk> in two <unk> putting and this in a variety of them , they expand and a little bit more about the voice to it .
now in -- i have a bass , adding .
now i 'm still a play drums .
and now speeding up , i the filters out with the drums , so i the effect of live with taxes .
i can the entire sequence that speed , i was the rate in the one or another way <unk> .
and now speeding up , i the filter is still with the bass ; for something more expression .
i can the sequence , while they 're going to change .
so i have to do n't you in the reservations are planning , but you truly improvising ; they 're doing do or the inhabitants up .
and finally , i can the entire sequence <unk> , i the <unk> to left tend to .
thank you .
so as you can see , is my desire in it , new <unk> to develop , the better to the best fit , how our brains and bodies to work .
and today i had time , you a part of these new <unk> and some of possibilities of to show , what we in our lab to work .
the idea , which i them with the want to , is that we 're looking at the threshold to this new generation of <unk> to interact with digital media are , the information in our world to bring , the our needs to .
thank you ,
i 'm on the conversations with you all .
