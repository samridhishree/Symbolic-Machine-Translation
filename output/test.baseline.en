when steve lopez , funny the going to los angeles times , one day through the streets of the center of going to los angeles , went , he heard a beautiful music .
they came from a man , an african-american , how likable , notoriously rough , are homeless , the on a violin , playing , the only still two strings .
many of you are the story that you know , because of <unk> article about it was later a book , that again , a movie was , robert <unk> junior , when steve lopez , jamie <unk> as nathaniel anthony <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> school , and the very promising was tragically the early by his paranoid schizophrenia , was ended .
nathaniel left the juilliard school , suffered a <unk> and 30 years later , living it as homeless man on the streets of <unk> row in the center of going to los angeles .
i 'm going to everybody , <unk> book to read or to the film at , so they 're not just the wonderful about interconnection , understand the between these two men that 's the world , but , like the music that human-ocean connection to make it , and how they finally this instrument was , when that preacher allows is , that <unk> , nathaniel away from the road to get .
i 've <unk> , basically in 2008 , two years ago , in the walt disney <unk> hall .
he had just a demo of <unk> first , and fourth symphony of and got behind the stage , to try to me to imagine .
he talked in a very <unk> and social tone of yo-yo ma , hillary clinton , and it , like the dodgers abandoned it 's ever in the from the world series of creating would . and that all for the <unk> passage of violin at the last sentence of <unk> fourth symphony .

i must have to say , that nathaniel a medical <unk> , because he was already with <unk> and with <unk> and <unk> been treated , a trauma , that it all his life being made .
as a result of it 's now , especially vulnerable to these schizophrenic phases . that are sometimes it gets so , and he days away , in the streets of <unk> row <unk> , that the horror and the <unk> of his own mind 's exposed .
and in just as a <unk> was wondering , nathaniel , when we do with our first to class in the walt disney <unk> hall , began . he had this 'm the flickering in his eyes and this seemed completely lost .
he talked about the invisible , demons and smoke and it , it does anyone in their sleep and poison .
i was afraid , not donated , but i was afraid , that i saw him lose it could , that it in one of the conditions , get it could and that i was to its relationship to a violin at the could , when i started , about <unk> and <unk> and another very exciting to form of <unk> <unk> to talk .
i started so just playing .
i played the first set of <unk> <unk> .
and while i was playing , i noticed , that in <unk> eyes a full of years ago , went .
it was , as if it under the impact of an invisible have said , a chemical response , of the catalyst of my game .
<unk> <unk> rage and turning , in understanding , in a quiet for curiosity and immensity required .
and how through a miracle , he took his violin and started , to be heard some clips from <unk> to play and asked me then , you to end to play , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
we started then , about music to talk , starting from the stream of beethoven , <unk> , <unk> and all the other protocell b , of <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
and i became clear , that he 's not just a <unk> know about music owned , but it with you also a tight personal relationship there .
he spoke of her with a passion and a way , that i do n't just one of my colleagues in the philharmonic of going to los angeles , i know .

music is medicine . music , changes us .
for nathaniel means that music <unk> health .
because the music , it allows him , his thoughts and delusions to his imagination and creativity in a real to transform .
and so <unk> he finds its waited to situation .
i realized , that that 's exactly the essence of art is .
what this is the reason , why we music to do : so we do something , that in all of us , of the curriculum is , our feelings , by our artistic lens , through our creativity to the real life forms .
and the fact that expression , all of us , and moves , inspired , and that unites us .
what nathaniel <unk> , that brought him the music back in a community of friends .
the <unk> power of music got it back in a family of musicians , that it 's mind , the be a talent and realized , and it through quantitative data .
and i 'm going , with nathaniel music , no matter whether the case , walt disney <unk> hall , or in <unk> row , because he reminds me , it 's why i musicians to become am .
thank you .
bruno giussani : thank you . thanks .
robert gupta .
robert gupta : i want to play , that i <unk> the <unk> stolen .
i hope , they pardon me .
so i have in my life , many fishes were known .
i just two very loved .
this first , this was more like a passionate caplin ; it .
it was a fish , <unk> good , it , <unk> , a best-selling book on the menu .
what for a fish .
still better , he was in <unk> after the walk on the standards of sustainability from .
you could be wondering , so i feel about that , it to sell it .
i had with this beauty of a sense of several months .
one day , called the head of the company . and said , if i at an event , which might think about the sustainability in the farm .
`` course , '' i said .
here was a company , the ability to try , what this incredible this problem for us chefs 's gone . how do we fish on our menus ?
in the last 50 years , we have the sea fish out how we forests <unk> did .
it 's hard , the destruction had to <unk> .
90 percent of the big fish , the , that we love , the major tuna , the <unk> , the <unk> , this swordfish , they 're totally collapsed .
it 's almost nothing more left .
so it will probably disney or something <unk> , <unk> , a part of our future .
a lot of arguments against . <unk> pollute the environment , most of them anyway , and they are inefficient , we take these tuna . a big disadvantage .
he has a <unk> of 15 to one .
that is , 15 pounds <unk> are required , so you a pounds <unk> get .
not very sustainable .
it tastes , not very good .
so here was finally one company , the tried , it right .
i wanted you support .
the day , the event , i called the head of <unk> for the company .
we call him , don .
`` don , '' i said , `` just to the facts are right to have , you are famous for , so far out in the sea , to grow , to the environment , not really polluted water . ''
`` this is true , '' he said , `` we are so far out , that the waste of our fish you will , not quite concentrated . ''
and then on it 's add , `` we 're basically , a own world .
this <unk> of <unk> to one , '' he said .
`` the best in the industry . ''
<unk> to one , great .
`` <unk> to one of what ? what she feeds on her ? ''
`` how sustainable proteins , '' he said .
`` great , '' i said , put on .
and at that night , i was in bed and i thought , what the hell is a sustainable protein that ?
so i the next day , briefly , the event , don .
i said , don , for example , are sustainable proteins right ? ''
he said , he had her that 's not . he 'll ask folks .
now , i guy with a few people in the company . nobody could tell me a 's answer , until i finally begin with the senior fellow biologists and this guy .
we call him as well , don .
`` don , '' i said , `` what for example , are sustainable proteins right ? ''
now , he mentioned , some algae and some <unk> , and then he said , <unk> .
i said , `` <unk> ? ''
he said , `` yes , putting feathers , skin , <unk> , but , <unk> and to forage and processes . ''
i said , `` how much percent of belief consume it 's chicken ? `` well ,
in the assumption of maybe two percent .
`` well , that are about 30 percent , '' he said .
i said , don , which is , it 's chicken at the fish to feed ? ''
there 's a break in the leadership and he said , `` there 's easy to a chicken , on earth . ''
i <unk> me from this fish .
no , not , because i was a <unk> <unk> and <unk> am .
that i 'm actually .
no , i <unk> fact , from this fish <unk> , because , i swear , god , the fish , this entertainment , chicken , tasted star .
this second fish , this is a different kind of year-old .
it 's the romantic sort of , the way , the you , ever better , his fish even know , learns , you the fish that the more love .
i told him , first in a restaurant in <unk> eaten .
a <unk> journalist who had been thinking about this fish , spoke .
they have to kind of the <unk> .
he came on the table with a light , almost glowing the color .
the chef dan had him <unk> .
you know , twice .
amazingly , it was still delicious .
who can a fish that well taste and let me , after he <unk> was ?
i ca n't it , but this guy put it .
we call him miguel sokoloff . actually means he says jose miguel sokoloff .
and no , he has the fish are not a cook and he 's not a chef . at least in the way , that you and i have to understand .
he 's a biologist in <unk> la <unk> .
this is a <unk> in the <unk> corner <unk> .
you is near the <unk> of the river <unk> .
until in the 1980s , was the farm in the hands of <unk> .
they 're domesticated <unk> on the , which basically , the wetlands .
they did this transition , you this country <unk> .
they built this complicated tomes of sewers , and they had urged her water from the land out and out in the river .
now , they could n't do that was , not quite cost-effective .
and ecologically . it was a catastrophe .
it brought about 90 percent of birds to , which for this place , many birds are .
and that has in a spanish company with green the country .
what they 've done ?
they have the rivers of the water , vice versa .
they 've literally the lever <unk> .
instead of the water <unk> did they the channels , to the water again <unk> .
they <unk> the channels .
they created a thousand on <unk> -- <unk> , <unk> , the shrimp , eel that -- and i 've miguel , and his company in the environmental destruction , vice versa .
the farm is incredible .
i mean , they have something that still never seen .
you stare out on the horizon , the one million miles away is , and everything what you 're <unk> channels and this dense , lush march .
i was there , not too long time with miguel sokoloff .
he 's an incredible guy , three parts by charles darwin and a part , `` a crocodile , kissing . ''
okay ? there we were and she fought alongside us through the wetlands and i <unk> and <unk> , we 've been on to my at , and miguel holding in peace one <unk> .
here 's it 's a rare <unk> .
now talk about it 's the <unk> of phytoplankton .
and here , see here 's a pattern of split , that it at the <unk> giraffe , remember .
it turns to start out , that is miguel the most of his career in <unk> national park in africa has spent .
i asked him , and it to like a <unk> 's gone .
he said , `` fish ? i know nothing about the fish .
i 'm an expert , for connection . ''
and then , it and sudden plummets , in more maybe of those rare in the birds and algae and weird <unk> .

it 's great , but i was in love .
and my head was going to be about this <unk> piece here 's a fish , that i the brink .
so i put it gets broken . i said , `` miguel , , how come to your fish that well taste ? ''
he showed up with the algae .
`` i know , boy , the algae , of phytoplankton , the relationships , it 's unbelievable .
but what we eat your built-in fish ?
how is the <unk> ? ''
now , it continues to me to tell , that it 's a rich system is , the fishes better food , what you in the wilderness of food they would .
the more vegetable biomass , and phytoplankton , the <unk> , this is it , what the fish , feeds .
the system is so healthy , it 's completely <unk> .
there 's no food .
the of a farm heard , the way they are not an ?
later on day i went on this site , is miguel around and i asked him , i said , `` for a place , the so obviously this seems to be , '' different than any of farm , the i ever been was , `` how to measure , you are succeeding ? ''
moment , it was , as if a <unk> a <unk> to have .
and we must bow to the corner and we provided to the most sight , thousands and pinker flamingos , a literally , pinker carpet and so far the eye can see .
`` that 's success , '' he said .
`` look to their bellies on , pink .
they <unk> . ''
<unk> ? i was really confused .
i said , `` miguel , <unk> they 're not your fish ? ''
yes , he said .
`` we 're lost 20 percent of our fish and <unk> at the birds .
now , last year we were on this site 600,000 , birds , more than 250,000 ways .
it is the largest and one of the most private <unk> in all of europe .
i said , `` miguel , is a good <unk> <unk> not the last , that you on a <unk> have to ? ''
he 's going , his head , no .
he said , `` we build <unk> , not hard .
this is a who network .
the flamingos , and eat the shrimp .
the shrimp , and eat the phytoplankton .
you , pinker looks so the belly and more than the system . ''
okay , you make us that has come . a farm , the way they are not an and a farm , the their success on the health of some measure .
a <unk> , but also a <unk> .
oh , and the way to these flamingos covered by the first place , not even be there .
they breed in a city are 240 miles away , where the evaporated and better , it 's <unk> .
every morning to modify them are 240 miles to farm .
and every night to modify them are 240 miles back .
they do that , because they the <unk> white line the highway <unk> follow .
seriously .
i had a trip across the penguins had imagined , so i went miguel sokoloff .
i said , `` miguel , fly , they are 240 miles to the farm and fly you are 240 miles back on the evening ?
they do that for the children ? ''
he looked at me , as if i just a song from the whitney , and houston , quotes .
he said , `` no . they do that , because the food is better . ''
i 'm not the capability of my beloved fish and i said , the most delicious was , and i do n't like <unk> . i ca n't you <unk> . i ca n't you crunchy food .
it 's this <unk> , <unk> flavor .
i 'm cooking , almost never seen it .
and yet , when i told them in this restaurant in <unk> try to have she have n't even after <unk> tasted star .
they did sweet and in , as if you a half bites the ocean take it .
i mentioned that , is miguel , and he take naps every time .
he said , `` the skin it looks like a swam .

they have to start over the evolution , we developed to <unk> suck . ''
and then on it 's add , `` but our drinking water has no <unk> . ''
okay . a farm , the your fish do n't it feeds . a farm , the their success is the success of its predators .
and then i was clear , if he says , a farm , the no <unk> has , <unk> he 's powerful , because the water , that through this farm where there 's coming from the river <unk> in .
it 's a river , of all the things with rhinovirus . the it , of rivers , today to pitch , you with it lead , chemical pollutants , flow of <unk> .
and if it spreading through the system , fighting , and this leaves is the waters clean , how it <unk> is .
the system is so healthy , it cleans the water .
so not just a farm , the way they are not an , not just a farm , the their success on the health of its predators , measures , but a farm , the literally a <unk> is , and not just for these fish , but also for you and me .
because if the water <unk> , <unk> it in the atlantic .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i take him , and that they should also do , because those six year-old , like this was also always , is also telling .
you might say , you to a recipe is the future of good food , whether we of <unk> or <unk> talk .
what we now we need , is a radical new concept of agriculture , from one , in the food in fact , taste .
but for many people like this is a little to radically changed .
we 're not <unk> , we <unk> . we 're lover .
we love <unk> . we love this little <unk> . we 're talking about local food . we eat will be organic .
and if you say , that the things are , the future of good food can assure everybody 's somebody somewhere and says , `` hey guys , i love the pink flamingos , but how they will feed the world ?
how they will feed the world ? ''
can i be honest ?
i like this question .
no , not , because we have enough calories are producing , to the world more than just to feed .
one billion people are today <unk> .
one billion -- this is more than ever -- because <unk> inequalities that in the distribution , not the <unk> .
now , i like this question , not because they the logic of our <unk> the last 50 years about . we have .
feed , corn products . <unk> , <unk> at monocultures , chemicals at the earth , grilled chicken at the fish , and all the time has the agribusiness , just wondered : `` if we more people who do you feed , how awful can it be ? ''
this was the motivation . it was the , which is . it was the plan that the american agriculture .
we should they call , what you is , a if you in <unk> , a if you really , that fast , who came to its , that 's those of the technologies .
this is not if you really , and it 's not invent agriculture .
our <unk> is threatened , not because <unk> <unk> , but because <unk> resources ,
not by the latest <unk> and <unk> , but through the fertile one country , not by the pumps , but through fresh water , not by a chainsaw , but through the forests , and not by were doing and nets , but through the fish in the sea .
they want to feed the world ?
let them to start with the question : how we going to feed itself ?
or better , how we can help conditions do , that every community to enable , to itself to feed ?
so to do this , you look not on the <unk> for the future .
it 's really old , and it 's done .
capital , chemistry and ever-faster machines are at <unk> and it has never heard something really good for food produced .
we look , the ecological systems model .

let you try to miguel , farmers like miguel ,
businesses , the n't worlds for yourself to are , businesses , the where instead <unk> , businesses , the <unk> growing some rather than just hard , farmers , the not just the second-highest are , but experts , for connection ,
because they are ones , the also hired experts to flavor .
and when i really quite frankly , i 'm sure you 're a better at us as i do it ever be going .
you know , that 's me , right , because if that the future of good food is , is it delicious .
thank you .
if i do you today , one of creatures wants it 's , that the totality of data , that we consume , it 's bigger than the sum of the parts and instead of at <unk> to think , i want to you think about how we information that can use , that the pattern matches up and that we actually see , the otherwise would n't have been visible to be .
so , what we see here 's a typical <unk> to old way .
this program , that i 'm running here , is a little experiment .
it 's called <unk> and what i do with <unk> can do is , i after a certain death to filter it , we say , accidents .
and instantly i see a different patterns , that , it .
and it , because in <unk> here in the people at the <unk> are and they over here at the <unk> .
we can a step further out and figure out the data and new , and see , that <unk> and cancer , the usual suspects out there are , but not for everyone .

and who <unk> looks like , that is especially for men in true .
you see , that look of information and data in this way , very likely to swim in a living <unk> 's uncertainty .
and if we do this for raw data can make , why not , the content in itself ?
what we now have here are the front covers , every single , `` the sport <unk> '' , the ever woken up .
it 's all . it 's everything online .
you can it would like to my talk in their rooms and test .
with <unk> you can just in a decade .
you can just in a particular year .
they can go directly to a certain period of jumping .
now if i here looking , i see the athletes , the in these kinds of sand appear and the sports .
i 'm a lance armstrong 's a fan , so i click go down to me all expenses that show in front of lance armstrong and i will .
now , when i just a <unk> , what you get to , i could think , `` ok , what if i do anything with the subject of walking , i look ? ''
so i step back and <unk> the way .
now i 'll be greg <unk> .
and so you get an idea of them , that if you this information on , specifically , , much more <unk> , <unk> , for you do n't or <unk> not just .
you do something , that actually a little differently .
it 's something between , and we think it changes the way , and the way as information can be .
i want this idea now a little out on with about what a little crazed .
so here we 've done is , we have any of <unk> and you on a little summary .
the summary , which one , and often , and a symbol for the area of them coming .
i 'm just passed , the top , in the popular <unk> .
but even in this unconstrained view , we can have a lot of things do .
now we get a sense of the issues , the on wikipedia , the popular .
so i 'm the issue <unk> '' vote .
now , after i <unk> ' one of have you know what i realized that the <unk> , the , the most likely to meet `` time magazine , `` people of the year . '' are .
this is really important , there is an insight is , the not in a single <unk> 's .
this is just to see if you one step back and the entire at .
overlooking is in a certain that <unk> i can then in this time magazine , `` people of the year . '' go , and all together .
now if i say these people consider you know what i realized that the majority of <unk> . some people come from the science . some , still less , come from the economy . here is my head . and one comes from the <unk> .
and interestingly , is a bono 's also a ted prize winner .
so we can now to jump , and a look at all the ted prize winner 's .
you see , we 're surfing the first time this as if it also really a net is , not just by side to side , but how much more abstractly .
and so i want you what else to show what a little surprise -- may be .
i 'll show you here 's just the new york times website .
<unk> , this app -- i want it 's not a browser , call it ; it 's not a browser , but you can do web to look -- and we bring these <unk> to each of website , like this .
so i can one step back , and directly to a specific <unk> jump .
this is why most important , because you just through that look of websites are in these kinds of and the way , all the <unk> in the same way , and the way of yourself .
so i can in my as we can zoom in a certain time .
there 's the state of the demonstration , that i 'm going to go on .
and i can sort everything , what 's what i 've been looking at what you have , back .
and , when i go back one step <unk> and on all look , can i mean by the new way , after my <unk> . here , i have to <unk> ' `` for , here , bing , right here to live from labs <unk> .
and from here i can in the side , which and they went back up .
it 's a metaphor , the way , it 's used , and every time , it makes this picture than the sum of data .
the moment , in this world , we think , that 's a curse .
we 're talking of , cursing the <unk> .
we talk from `` from drowning in information . ''
what if we this situation around you could and the internet on the head , imagine , so that we instead , one of the other to go , start of many things to many things go to be able , and it 's see , what otherwise would actually stayed still be ?
if we do that can , is this record <unk> , maybe a new source more information .
and , instead , just in information to move , we can we know it to get .
and if we know about , then we can maybe even the wisdom of it .
so i hear on , thank you .
i grew up with a <unk> portion of science fiction .
in my school , i went to the bus to school , every day an hour a way .
and my nose was always in a book , a <unk> , that my mind in other worlds <unk> and on <unk> way that i feel deep in me sitting , voracious , curiosity satisfied .
this curiosity that , as well , that i always , when i 'm not at school was , through the forests <unk> , walking and `` 25,000 samples . '' which collected , frogs and snakes and every now , and <unk> , everything to home to paint and under the microscope at the paintings .
i was totally <unk> , you know .
it was that always going to the trial , the world to understand and the limits of explore .
and my love to science fiction was wondering , in my picture , since then , in the late '60s , we went to the moon and they were exploring the deep ocean .
jacques cousteau came in our living with his amazing . shows that we animals and places and a whole world of wonder , they did , that we 'd never looked like you can imagine .
that has then i believe is very good to do it at <unk> <unk> .
and i was an artist .
i could draw . i could paint .
and there 's no video still have these <unk> with computer-generated know what 's still the imagery in the media , there , i had the images in my head of activities .
that we had at all . if we as kids a book , i read , we took the description of the author and projected needs them at the screen in our minds .
my response to that was the drawing and draw from alien , alien worlds , robots , the spacecrafts , and all so what .
in class , i was always the teachers get it , as i thought , below the textbook on , <unk> .
the creativity to know , somehow figure out .
and i was something interesting . what i , which is to jacques <unk> they were intrigued , was the idea at a us to be completely unseen world here on our planet itself .
certainly would i mean , never an alien world with a spacecraft to achieve . this seemed to me very much .
but here was a world , that i actually enter it could , here on the earth , and she was also fascinating and more exotic as all that , that i 've always imagined was , when i those books had read .
so i decided , when i was 15 , scuba divers .
the only problem with it was that , i in a tiny village in canada , living , one over 12,000 miles away from the ocean away .
it 's what i let me , but not <unk> .
i 've been bugging my father , until he got a <unk> in the shittiest climate , new york , participants had made , exactly the other side of the border , where we lived .
i made my <unk> in a pool of <unk> in the winter , in the shittiest climate , new york .
the ocean , but , a real , the ocean , i got only two years later to face , when we need to california to .
since , in the 40 years , the meanwhile , <unk> are , i spent about three , hours , under water is this . 500 million hours of them in <unk> .
and i learned that the world of the deep , even in the <unk> oceans , so rich enough to <unk> life is , how we really hardly anyone can imagine .
the imagination , the nature 's no borders , very , as opposed to our own , <unk> human imagination .
to the world today , and i feel that i then the awe , that , what i have on my early dives , i see .
and my love to the ocean is looking at , with the same intensity as jesus , and ever .
when i then as an adult encountering a profession <unk> , it was the <unk> .
this seemed the best way , my inner drive , stories to tell , with my desire , images to create , to unite .
as a little i always on the comic books and so .
so we were no movies , the way , images and stories <unk> . that fit together .
now , we were the stories , that i <unk> , from the science fiction , `` the terminator , '' `` aliens , '' and `` <unk> . ''
in `` <unk> '' i was my penchant for the <unk> and that come with the <unk> together .
so intertwined . of my two passions .
something interesting happened , `` <unk> '' : to a <unk> problem in this film to solve -- and that is , we had this is a kind of liquid <unk> create -- , you know , we 're on a computer-generated animation , <unk> , back .
what came up with , was the computer-generated <unk> , the ever in a film to see .
the movie , got it 's no money , a , just said , it does he just passed , his prosaically by a , but i realized something fascinating , the audience around the world was like to be mesmerized by the magic , the it was initiated .
according to arthur clarke 's law . you know , <unk> technology and magic . out to distinguish kin .
they were so something magic .
and that i found it 's incredibly exciting .
and i said , `` wow this must have done in the cinematic be involved . ''
so we went in `` the terminator , two , '' my next movie , still much more .
and with <unk> created we there , the guy of liquid metal . the success were very top of them , like this effect , it would .
and it worked . again , we had something magic . and the effect in the audience was the same . but we have to the film have a little bit more money <unk> .
of these two experiences from , was a very new world , a very new world of creativity to <unk> .
so i was a company , along with my good friend with stan winston , the way to look at the best <unk> and <unk> was . she was called `` the digital <unk> . ''
the idea of the company was it , that 's an analogous processes with the visual printers etc . to skip ahead and the same with digital <unk> to start .
that we did , and lead us as a while a competitive advantage .
but the '90s , what we yet , that we in <unk> and <unk> -- what we the company , actually started had -- to slow <unk> .
i had this piece `` computational avatar . '' written , that the <unk> in terms of visual effects and <unk> effects in all of new heights , push it should , realistic human , expressive characters , the spring from <unk> been produced . and the <unk> should all <unk> be . and the world to <unk> be .
but the <unk> put stuff back . and the people in my company told me , that we <unk> still not in the ability to be , that to create .
so , shifted that 's what i and made this other film about the big ship , that goes .
the <unk> i have this as `` romeo and juliet on a ship . '' he sells . it was a <unk> distilled <unk> , a film .
in ways , but i wanted to actually the real ants cover up the titanic to immerse ourselves .
it 's why i have the movie .
that 's the truth . that we knew that , but not .
i 've got them , but i believe , i said , `` we come to the cover up . we know what 's the real up .
we will it in the <unk> of the movie .

and i <unk> you , an expedition to finance .
sounds crazy . but that goes back to that , that your own imagination a reality to create .
we then created in fact , six months later a reality , in the time i 'm in russian <unk> end , four kilometers from the surface of the atlantic , and i think about the real titanic amount of a <unk> at .
this was not a film , not definition , that was so .
so , that has really amazes me away .
and the preparation that were enormous . we had to give cameras and a spotlight , and anything possible building .
and i fell on , very these <unk> , a <unk> similar .
well , they were also <unk> and <unk> <unk> planning .
you ascend back in that cramped capsule , which you in this dark , hostile environment , down , where no hope in saving is , there 's not even back to do .
and i said , `` wow , that 's also , as if i 'm in <unk> .
this is really cool . ''
i was it was obsessed by studying the deep ocean .
anyway , of the part , the with curiosity and science has to do . it was all . it was an adventure , it was a curiosity . it was an imagination .
and it was an experience , the me to do n't give you can do .
because , you know , i was able to me a creature , imagine , for that we then a visual effect which could . but i could n't tell me that 's imagine , what i of a window would see .
in some sort of the following expeditions i being in <unk> seen , and sometimes these things , that i still never seen before i had , sometimes , things , the first place . nobody ever seen before i had , and for that science to the time , when we do you saw , still not even words , he had found .
that has to me , so really transformative , and i wanted more .
and so i then a something unusual thing you .
after the success of `` titanic '' i told , `` okay , i want to my <unk> as a filmmaker , in hollywood goes on ice , and i 'm going to a while <unk> . ''

we returned to cover up the titanic transition back .
we took a little robots , that we built were , the a <unk> <unk> .
our intention was , <unk> and the inside of the ship to watch , what you 've never did was on .
nobody had ever that inside of <unk> demands . you 'd still not for another . so we have developed that technology .
well , and there sitting i now , on the deck of the titanic , in a <unk> , and i see <unk> , that <unk> 's quite similar , and of which i know , that once the band , there 's coupons .
and i am being with a little <unk> through the aisles of the ship .
i if it 's just really , but my mind is inside of <unk> .
it felt yourself to , as if i spaces inside of <unk> the titanic and there .
that was the <unk> of <unk> , that i 've ever experienced . because before i each to a corner on , i 've always been , in the <unk> of <unk> up to say , because i conducted months of <unk> did was , when we the movie on .
this is set it was , which is an exact replica of the design plans of the ship .
so that was a very strange .
they made me this <unk> aware , that you have such <unk> avatars and use and so that own consciousness in the vehicle , in these different form of existence embarrassed .
it was an incredibly profound
and may also a brief reference , that , maybe in a few decades , could happen , if you <unk> has to something to explore , or other things to do , in all kinds <unk> <unk> , that i resolved than <unk> imagine .
after these expeditions we started this , what we get down there had seen , really appreciate is to learn , for those <unk> , where we these amazing how they saw . that are sort of the aliens , but here on earth .
they live to help of chemosynthesis .
they 're not in the sunlight , but the system , how we do this .
and so you see animals , the next to a 500 of degrees are called them to survive there .
the same time so i also very much for <unk> , that was again , the <unk> from my childhood .

this was amazing .
but the end , it was on out , that i <unk> with us in the deep took .
i took them , and <unk> you access to the world upside down there , <unk> , <unk> , people , the , for such extreme conditions were . i took them to the sources to , so they look around , where we take and instruments , see , and so forth .
we turned on a documentary films , they -- but actually visualize science , more specifically , <unk> .
so effectively lock yourself to the circle anywhere between my existence as <unk> , at a child , and the execution in the reality .
, over these landscapes as i have a lot of them .
i have a lot of science had learned . but now i think they certainly , a director to also can lead , a leader be like a <unk> or so .
i understood , but not a lot of leadership , before i do this ocean expeditions <unk> .
because at a particular point i had to tell me , `` what i do is actually here ?
why i do that ? what comes out of it ? ''
these stinking movies migrate to us no money .
we play time on the by a . of fame , not a trail .
all think , i was between , `` titanic '' and `` computational avatar . '' <unk> and i 'd let me in the nails it on a towel that the beach <unk> .
i 've all these films , this in documentary , for a very small one audience .
not a fame , not honor , no money . what are you just ?
you 're doing it to the task will , to the challenge for -- and the ocean is the <unk> environment , that there 's . you 're doing it of <unk> because , and because of funny connection , the creation is , if a small group of people have a team is .
because we have all this with only 10 to 12 people did , the years , non-stop 've been . sometimes we were to two , three months on the lake .
and in this community who you , the most important thing that will be aware is , that you , one has , because you a task does it has , that you any other things to explain .
if you look at the land back and to say , `` we had to do it , this fiberglass , the <unk> , and this very vague , the whole technology , and the trouble , the human <unk> , sea , working , '' , you can this other just do n't explain . that 's like at the officer or at the soldiers , the something together we have gone through and to know , they it never met anyone can explain .
there is a connection , a rectangle within each other respect .
when i so back , to my next film `` computational avatar . '' to turn , i tried to the same to 300,000 apply it , which is that you can be a respected and wondering , in return to respect , deserves .
it was the dynamic really changed .
because i was so again with a small team on the unknown terrain . we did that , `` computational avatar . '' with a new technology , that it 'd still not there .
it 's incredibly exciting .
an enormous challenge .
and we were for a period of four years to a real .
it changed . my way , films to do , completely .
it was giving people , the said , we have these <unk> yes , really good <unk> and the planet pandora 's used to go .
for me it was more a <unk> way , my job to do , the actual process , the , in the result has changed .
so what can we from all of finish ?
the lessons we 've learned ?
i think , at first place is the curiosity .
it 's the most powerful of human property .
our imagination is a force , the fact , a reality to create .
and the aware of your team is more than all <unk> this world .
come to me a young , filmmaker , the say , they give me a benign advice , like that can do . ''
and i say , `` <unk> you do n't even a .
that could have another for you . do n't it to myself , she 'll do n't pretend to themselves . but to take risks on you . ''
the nasa has been so a <unk> , `` failure is not an alternative . ''
but in the art and the study to fail as an alternative to be , because there , guarantees that 's a leap .
no big endeavor , that innovation , leaving , was ever done without risk being addressed .
you must be ready , these risks on it .
that 's the idea , which i like to with the want to leave . failure is quite an alternative , fear but it 's no . thanks .
today i 'm going to you about energy and climate .
and this surprised , maybe something , because of my <unk> at the foundation , mainly due to the vaccines , and seed is , to the things , that we make up , and to have to the poorest two billion a better life to sustain .
but energy and climate are extremely important for those people , just took even more than for each other on the planet .
<unk> means that , whose <unk> over many years n't grow up . it we need to a lot sooner or to get out of rain . the things going to that change , it 's on their fragile environment is not withstand shock .
this leads to <unk> . it leads to handle uncertainty . it leads to food riots .
so , is a climate change in fact , they 're going .
and it 's the <unk> for you very important .
fact is , , if you just from one , the price down could , to <unk> would energy in exactly the most effective .
now , the <unk> is about the time in favor .
actually based on the <unk> on <unk> .
the <unk> of the industrial revolution . and even in the 20th century . there 's a <unk> case in <unk> and why we 've refrigerators -- that painless climate , we can use in a materials on , and so many things do .
so we 're in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world .
but , if we the price down -- we let us the price to half -- we meet in a new green barrier , and this barrier is closely with carbon .
co2 fed up the planet and the equation for carbon dioxide 's actually very clear .
they <unk> that <unk> co2 , which to <unk> and that is that <unk> has some very negative to follow . effects on the weather and maybe even worse , the indirect result , the natural ecosystems , such <unk> changes not to be able and so a whole systems to come together .
now , the exact same relationship between a <unk> and the by going <unk> and where the spawning more drastic consequences are , there 's these are certain ambiguity state , but not very many .
and there 's safe <unk> about , how bad those consequences . but they 'll be very bad be .
i have the <unk> times , and asked , `` we have to really shut down on the near zero to come ?
does n't the half or a quarter ? ''
the answer is , until we 're near zero to come to the temperature on giving rise .
so it 's a big challenge .
it 's very different than to say , we have a fully three feet high office truck , the under a consortium 3 feet a bridge on back to . the then you can of ruins underneath them back down .
this must . it down to , in zero .

every american about 20 tons . people of the poor countries , less than one .
the average are 's about five million tons for each one on the planet .
and somehow we have to change that will it on going down .
it 's been the same way up .
just different economic potential to have it 's actually affects and we have of <unk> in order to reduction , and to a reduction , in zero .
that equation , has four factors . a basic multiplication problem . they have this thing left -- and co2 -- that helped them towards zero to break , and this is from the number of people depend on , of the service , that every person in the average use , the average of energy for every human services and the co2 , that per unit <unk> of .
you make us so every single factor of them and look carefully , we , how we do that in zero .
likely to one of these numbers very close to zero .
now this is the basic algebra , but we take it 's , through .
so we have the population .
today life was 6.8 billion people .
and it 's what in nine billion . the , in nine billion to move .
if we 're very successful with new vaccines , the <unk> and <unk> are we could that i do to 10 percent to 15 percent mortality down , but , what we see a slope to 1.3 .
the second is a factor that are the services , that we use .
and that includes all , the food , that we eat , clothing , television , heating .
that are very good things and <unk> mean , those services , almost every working on the planet accessible to .
it 's wonderful , that this number up .
in the rich world , in the upper half billion , we could probably <unk> do and less use , but the average is that number of every year go up and wondering , so collectively than double , the number of services , the per person has not going .
here we see a very basic services . there 's going to home light , so you the homework can read it ?
and those students have it 's not , so what they go out and reading your schoolwork whatsoever to the <unk> .
now , in efficiency , the e , the power per service , there 's got news .
we have something , that 's not going up ,
because of success in <unk> , each other <unk> , through new ways in <unk> , there 's a lot of services , their energy needed some of services , let 's going to start to 90 percent down .
in one of service , like the making of <unk> , is 105 <unk> -- <unk> <unk> or the <unk> or <unk> , is the scope for improvement is very much smaller .
in general , if we would make these are , we might be a reduction , to a factor of the three or maybe even to a factor of six .
but at the first three factors , we 're now of 26 billion in may <unk> 13 billion tons of gone . and that 's not just out !
we look so the fourth factor at -- and this is a , in his -- that is a lot of co2 , the per unit <unk> of .
it turns , the question if you that in zero can get .
if you coal , burning , no .
if you gas will burn , no .
almost every <unk> for electricity <unk> today , co2 , except that renewables , and my rocketry that .
so , what we on a global level to have to do , is , a new paradigm to create .
we need <unk> .
now if i the term `` wonders , '' means is , i mean not the impossible .
the microprocessor is a miracle . the computer is a miracle .
the internet and of services is a miracle .
the people here have to the development of a lot of this miracle that contributed .
normally , there 's not a deadline , that you a miracle to a certain kind of date , it needs .
normally what you can kind of just wrong and some people come , did n't .
with , we have but you floor , and give a miracle in very short time .
now , i wondered , how to really <unk> ?
there 's a natural place , a demonstration , the the idea of people here with ?
i think back at last year , when i mosquitos to somehow , they liked the people that .
the idea was for you actually intangible , you know that , people there , the with these life .
for energy , i noticed this .
i decided that <unk> of fireflies make my <unk> contribution to the environment , here would be .
so here are a couple of natural or fireflies .
you has told me , that they do n't bite . in fact , they will probably wo n't time that glass of .
now , there 's all kinds <unk> like this , but they get all not much .
we need technological solutions , either one or of the an incredible this scaling , and how incredible dependability . and although it many ways , there , in which people to find yourself , i really just five , that cause of the needs can afford .
i have the tides , <unk> , the merger and better biofuels out .
this is to do n't be a plotted the contributions and if you better to do when i expect , that would be great , but i mean the core here is , we looked at all those five have to work , and we ca n't of you give up , because they us imagine , because all have significant problems .
we look at the burning fossil fuels , burning of either way coal or gas .
what you there to alert , it seems to be easy , but this is n't . you have to all the co2 , that after the burning of anyway , and coming , capture , under pressure <unk> and then , somewhere between them , and hope that , there 's left .
there 's some well , it on a 60 percent -- 80 percent level of creating , but it on 100 percent to get it 's very difficult . and an agreement for the storage of co2 to make , is a big challenge . but the biggest problem here is the <unk> .
who 's going to ensure that ?
who can be to guarantee , which literally hours a billion times bigger than any kind of waste , you of <unk> and other things we can imagine ?
this is a lot of volume .

next , : my rocketry that .
the also has three big problems . the cost , especially in <unk> countries are high . the question after security , that you really feel that , nothing wrong can walk , despite the human participation , that the fuel not for weapons that 's used .
and what do you then with the garbage patch ?
because even though he did n't it 's very large , there 's a lot of concerns .
so three very difficult problems , that maybe even though they are , and at which you that work should .
the last three of the five , i 've summarized why .
it are those renewables , how they often be called .
and also the have -- although it is , they do n't make fuel you need -- they have some downsides .
for one is the <unk> , that these technologies create dramatic lower than the of <unk> .
that are <unk> , you 're headed by many of <unk> , 1,000 times more land area as a normal power .
and also see these vents stalling ,
the sun does n't seem the whole day , they seem , not every day and it blows , the wind and not the time .
so you must have , you kind of these vents 's dependent on , a way to have , the energy , in times when they do is available , to get .
there 's so large <unk> . there 's the challenges in the transmission . if we like , say , the power of the country is , you do n't just the technology , you must also with the risk around , the energy from where different from .
and there 's the <unk> .
and to the way to show , i 've all kinds of us batteries , that are made , at , the work for cars , computers , phones , <unk> , for everything . and that i did with the amount of an energy , which the world is , comparing them . i found out , that all the batteries , that we now producing , less than 10 minutes of maintains them , you could .
we need so here 's a breakthrough , something that to a factor of a better be that , as the approaches to the time .
this is not impossible , but it 's not easy .
that happens , you 're trying to , these <unk> sources of saying we 20 percent -- 30 percent of that falls to earth .
if you try to to 100 percent of it up trying to , they need a time in the magic battery .
now , where we going to go , what 's the right approach ?
a `` manhattan project . '' ? how we get the goal ?
what we need are many companies , the work at it . hundreds .
in each of these five different areas we need at least 100 people .
in many you will say , that are nuts . that 's good .
i think , here in the ted who are there are many , the way . there 's been engaged .
bill by one has multiple different companies , one of the one named <unk> the great <unk> .
<unk> <unk> invested in dozens of companies , the great things do and interesting ways , and i try this to support .
nathan myhrvold talks , and i pay for a company , the , may surprise , the nuclear approach to follow .
there 's some innovations in <unk> ; and modular , liquid .
the development has in this industry , some time ago i stopped , so it 's no big surprise , that some good ideas lying .

that 's quite a crazy idea .
but actually did you about to have thought , but you could never as to simulate , whether it would work , but since it in a supercomputer that there , you 're modeling and see , that : aye . with the right <unk> , it 's like from that , <unk> .
and because you that 99 percent of burning , is that <unk> very much better .
actually burning , the garbage , and you can even the waste of today for them as <unk> use .
instead , about the head to break , you simply burn it . one thing .
the low-enriched uranium dioxide is pace of , like a candle that .
you see , that 's a bar is , often , `` a traveling wave of the reactor , '' by the .
that solves it was something that <unk> .
this is a picture of a place in kentucky .
this is the waste , the 99 percent . you have the part , the right now to burn it will , <unk> so it <unk> uranium .
the reverse the u.s. embassy for hundreds of years .
and if you <unk> inexpensive and just <unk> , you have fuel for the rest of lifetime of the planet .
you know , there 's still many challenges , but it 's an example of many hundreds of concepts , that we need to move to come .
think we , how we do our success is , should .
how to our own testimony to look ?
now , we go to the goal , that we have to get and then we 're talking about the <unk> .
a lot about a lot of giving 80 percent reduction , until 2050 .
it 's very important , that we 're going to go .
the rest of 20 percent are in the poor countries to be produced , and still something that agriculture . hopefully will <unk> and cement , until then clean .
so this idea of the 80 percent to do , to the developed world , including those countries like china , their <unk> completely change .
the other note she says , whether we the <unk> technology , in fact , if you know , in all the developed countries used is , and we the way are , you to the rest to get .
that 's important .
this is a shift : this <unk> .
if we from there back , like that 2020 as testament to look ?
it should be back the two elements .
we should the <unk> use the reduction in the way to earth . ever , we <unk> , more low is the <unk> be mistaken diagnoses and also the temperature .
but actually is this note to the things that we are , the not completely to the <unk> lead , just right , or in fact that matter less as the other , which the rapidity of innovation for these major breakthroughs that .
this amazing breakthroughs that we have to you floor up and that we can measure , in <unk> , in <unk> and <unk> .
there 's many great books to this topic .
that al gore 's book `` we have the choice '' and david <unk> `` <unk> energy <unk> the people were the air . ''
you take it really , and create a framework . this wide would be discussed can , because we need to support of all sides .
there 's a few things , that come together to .
this is a request .
a very specific to accommodate that we this technology making .
if you me just a wish for the next 50 years from now , i could the president to choose , a vaccine that , and that i love , i could this desire to vote , the question is , <unk> <unk> without losing co2 is being invented . this desire to take , i .
this has the biggest impact .
if we have this desire to do n't get , the redwood will dig in between the long and those business people are terrible people are , between the u.s. and china , between the poor and the rich countries . and almost all live in these two billion are very much worse .
what we have so i do ?
for which means of <unk> i ?
we have to more the context of those .
if countries , in places like <unk> , they should not only about carbon .
they should those <unk> to go and they were horrified , of the ridiculous , low money , the for this using it approaches to spend .

we need to spread the message .
we have robust conversation was and full lead and also the things , the of the government to be done .
it is a desire , but i think , we can see him meet .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you . thank you .
thank you . just to <unk> something better to understand -- first , you get to us an idea of the scale that investment , there ?
bill gates : to the simulation in a supercomputer to do , all the great scientist to get , what we 've done , we just some 10 million . and even if we our materials in a russian nuclear reactor tested have , to make sure that , as to work , is you only in the <unk> million .
the tough to step is the building of the first vessel , another billion to find , the <unk> and the place the fact , the first of them .
once the first time . it is , when he that 's how i promised , everything is very clearly , because the economy , the <unk> is so different than in my rocketry passion , how we know it .

bg : exactly . now you have the reactor , to put into , so there 's many people and many instances , the go wrong . this thing where you put it opens and things that influences , or going . that 's not good !
but when you very cheap fuel , has , the fudge factor for 60 years into it -- you think about a column , and the point you have been buried , without the whole <unk> .
and it 's sitting there , and takes for 60 years , and then it 's done .
a nuclear reactor , the even a solution for the garbage is .
bg : yeah . now , what do with the garbage that happens : you can see him sitting there 's -- there 's much less than waste , with this method -- then they take him and grab him in the reactor and burn up .
and we start , we the garbage by taking , the already exists , the in these <unk> or <unk> at the salt reactors is . this is our <unk> .
so , this is , which for these reactors run a problem was , that , what we in our fill and this is that <unk> dramatically reduce that during this process .
but while you with different people , this world of opportunities that we 've talked ,
where 's the interest , so what really doing ?
bg : well , we 've still not on a place a zoning and there 's a lot more interesting <unk> for all the `` nuclear '' in the name is . there 's big interest and the people of the company was in russia , india , china -- i was here and have the energy , hit and talked about , how this is to <unk> does .
i 'm optimistic . you know , the french and the japanese and have something in the direction .
this is a nuance , one thing , the .
this is a crucial step forward , but it 's like a faster the reactor and some countries have this built , why is everybody , the a rapid reactor , which has , a <unk> for our first .
in your notion , time frame and the probability that really launched in to shout out ?
bg : well , we need one of <unk> , <unk> things , the 're very affordable , we have 20 years to innovate and then 20 years to use .
this is sort of the deadline , giving us the <unk> to see this has , that we all yours .
and , you know , <unk> , if all seems to is , and that 's a desire , would that easy to hold .
and fortunately , there 's now , dozens of companies , and we need hundreds , the , as well , when their approaches to work , the funding for your drone pilots to work , for <unk> .
and it would be the , if they are creating , since then you could be a mixture of use .
, we need a solution .
what the one of the world of major breakthroughs , this is the biggest , that you know ?
bg : a <unk> this is announcing .
that would it , without the <unk> been , but that makes it still so much more .
in a nuclear sector , there 's another very innovative companies .
you know , we 've met whose job is not so well , like this , but there 's the standard modular way , this is a different approach .
there 's a fluid <unk> , which is something hard to like , but you might say the workings of us .
and there 's different , but the beauty in it is , a <unk> a million times , so much energy has a bit like , we say , a <unk> and therefore , if you with the problems can get around and that are mainly the radiation , the footprint , and the cost , plays the potential , so the impact on the country and other things , in your own big league table .
if that does n't , what ?
we have <unk> need to try , the <unk> stable enough to balance ?
bg : if you in this situation is , it 's as if you to a lot has eaten , and just a heart attack . what do you then ? you might be a <unk> or something .
there 's a <unk> the way . <unk> called , the to start with various techniques , as well , to the warming continues to delay , so we 20 or 30 years longer had to us <unk> .
this is just a <unk> .
you hope , that we do n't need .
some people say , you should n't start to the insurance will work because one that might be lazy , so you and eats , because you know , that one of the <unk> save .
i do n't know , if that 's smart , is , if you the importance of this problem , and the it , but there 's now a larger discourse in <unk> about , if you that 's available to have to , if the things faster come , or this innovation , no longer need , when we expect .
change deniers like , you have a or two sentences for the idea of the way you to convince them ?
bg : well , in the skeptics in very different <unk> .
the ones , the science are doing , are very little .
they say that , negative effects , there , the with the clouds to have , the things here ?
there 's very , many things , that they do you can say , of it 's a chance in a million there .
this <unk> here is like in aids .
you do is the mistake now , and you pay for very much later .
and why is the idea , now , if you all kinds compiled all problems has , to invest in something that you only later , what has -- and there 's , the investment is not that 's clear . actually is the ipcc report did n't necessarily the worst case scenario , and there 's people in the rich world , the the ipcc look and say , okay , that 's no big , drama .
the fact is , that uncertainty of we have to do .
but my dream is , that , it , economic can do , the co2 was eliminated , say , the skeptics , `` okay , it does n't interest me , that 's no carbon <unk> , i wish provides nearly that , i did that , but i 'm going to it would accept , because it 's cheaper than the previous one way . ''
and that would your answer on the <unk> lomborg argument , that , if you look at that time and energy use to the co2 to solve the problem , all the other goals to suffer from it , the <unk> , that we face of malaria and so , that 's a stupid waste of resources , is , money to invest , it better stuff there , that we can do .
bg : well , the actual expenses for the research -- we say the u.s. to 10 billion per year , more to spend when they 're doing today -- and that 's not just dramatic .
it should be other things not suffer .
you then it comes to big <unk> , and here to bring sensible people on , if you something has , that 's not economic growth is , and tried , that to finance . for me is going on the most of waste .
it because , you is very briefly a <unk> and funded the only still the curve . i think we should be more things to try , the potential to have , very much cheaper .
if the <unk> , you get , a very high <unk> is , you can only the rich up .
i mean , each of us here i could take five times as much for our energy on without his lifestyle to change .
for the bottom two billion , but it 's a disaster .
and even lomborg comes with a way .
his new <unk> is now , `` why is the research . one ? ''
he 's still , because of its former stories , <unk> associated , but he has understood that a very lonely , who is , and so it 's now that <unk> .
and this is a insurgent , which i for them to think .
the research , it 's crazy , how little bit of the cause of .
bill , i think i speak for almost all people here , when i say , i really hope , to my wish is true . thank you very , .
bg : thanks .
few years ago , here at ted , and peter <unk> a <unk> called `` the <unk> '' ago .
the idea is quite simple . <unk> to the biggest <unk> structure with 20 <unk> , 10 . <unk> tape , 10 . <unk> thread , and a marshmallow ; building .
the marshmallow to on top .
and , though it really just like , it 's actually really though , because it people being very quickly work together .
and so i thought , that this is an interesting idea is that i and it in a <unk> into .
it was a huge success .
since i spent about 70 workshops and the world being done , with students , developers and architects , even with <unk> the <unk> and there 's something at this task , and down some insights in the nature of cooperation across the technologies and i want some of them to share with you .
usually run the most people to itself in the task to orient .
you talk about , you think , it will look , they <unk> to do ,
and invest , you a little time in planning and organization . they 're drawing and put <unk> .
they invest in a lot of their time in the to build the time plummeting and
and finally , just before they have no time have more money , somebody decodes the marshmallow and they put him gently in the top , where we step back and `` <unk> '' ! you adore them their work .
what but then , almost always , what happens is , `` the <unk> '' to a `` <unk> '' is , because the way of the marshmallow is causing , the whole thing , how you and <unk> .
there 's a number of people , the more , `` <unk> '' <unk> have more than others , and the worst of these are totally fresh <unk> .
they 're lying , they cheat , they are confused and make really <unk> shapes .
and of course , there 's team that much more , `` <unk> '' <unk> have and the best are the fresh alumni of this kindergarten .
and this is quite astounding .
like us , peter ward was to make you 're not just the highest towers , but the most interesting structures of all .
what you might ask will is : how is that ? why ? what about that ?
and peter 's telling : `` none of children spend on time in it 's head of <unk> <unk> to be . ''
they invest , no time in <unk> .
but there 's still one more reason .
and it , that mba students get trained by , a real original plan to find , ok !
and it and then to realize .
now what happens when you the marshmallow the top of profanity , they have no time more and what ?
it 's a crisis .
sound familiar , what ?
what <unk> do differently -- is , you with the marshmallow and start and prototypes to build , successful prototypes , with the marshmallow at the top , so that you can see the opportunity to have <unk> prototypes to fix .
constructionists recognize this kind of collaboration as a core of <unk> 's .
and with every attempt to get the children 's what we heard what works and what do n't .
this is the performance , prototypes to work , much -- but we see again , how other teams to operate .
the average for the most is at about . <unk> , mba students make half of that , or lawyers do something more , but not much , <unk> are better than the adults .
who is the most successful ?
architects and engineers , thankfully .
<unk> is the ultimate , what i 've seen .
and why ? because they are triangles began to understand and <unk> geometric patterns are the key to make stable structures to build .
and ceo of something about the average . but here 's interesting .
of you a we administrator at the team , you going to dramatically better .
it 's unbelievable . you 're going to start to and see , `` this team will win . ''
you can the predictions . why does it ?
because they particular skills of <unk> .
they run the process , you understand him .
and that team , that regulates body and the work to pay attention is the performance of teams and dramatically improve .
propagated across the skills and <unk> and the combination of lead to succeed .
if you 10 teams have , the typical of it , you ca . six , the robust -- structures .
i tried to ask , something very fascinating .
i thought , we bring the <unk> same .
so we 'd like i have a $ 10,000 dollars a price . their software for the winner .
what you think happened with these <unk> ?
what was the outcome ?
this happened . not a team had a robust structure .
if someone 's a <unk> high , which is built have , he have the price to home by .
so it 's not interesting , that high <unk> a powerful cooling effect of ?
we repeated this exercise with the students .
what you think happened now ?
well understood you the advantage of `` <unk> . ''
it was from the same , for team of the best .
they produced the highest construction in the least of time .
there 's so <unk> lessons for us , over the nature of the incentive and success .
you might ask : why would somebody actually time to invest in a <unk> to create ?
the reason is , i 'll help digital tools and processes to create the team to help , cars , video games , `` <unk> <unk> '' to construct .
and what the <unk> does is , help them hidden assumptions to identify .
because , frankly , each project has its own marshmallow .
the challenge is a shared experience , a common language , or obstruction . ethos , the right prototype stage to build .
and this is the value of this experience , so these simple little exercise .
and those of them , that 's interested , can <unk> go .
it 's a blog , where you see , how to the marshmallow .
there 's a <unk> there .
they find a crazy examples of the world , how people , the system to optimize and <unk> .
there 's also <unk> .
and the <unk> lesson , i think is , this structure actually a <unk> sports .
it demands , that we all our senses in the task to feelings and , that we think we can optimally use , how our feelings and we do , in the challenge , the now , for us is .
and sometimes it 's a small prototype this experience anything , what it needs to allow us from a `` <unk> '' -- to a `` <unk> '' moment to earth .
and that can make a big difference .
thank you .
we do so when we have this one machine ,
a big machine , a cool , <unk> machine , and this is a time .
and everyone in this room must go .
and you can in the past , go , you can in the future to go ; they can not in here and now to remain ,
and i wonder , what they vote would , because i my friends in a lot lately that question , which have , and they wanted everybody in the past .
i do n't know . they were interested in the time , before it , there or twitter or `` america for the american idol '' .
i do n't know .
i 'm convinced that you kind of the sort of nostalgia , to thinking drawn is .
and that i do .
i 'm not part of the group , i must say .
i do n't want in the past , and that 's not , because i 'm an urban explorers i am .
it is , it 's so on this planet does n't go back , you go forward .
so i want in this machine , and i want them in the future .
this is the greatest time , that 's ever attempted on this planet , there , no matter what scale , they make : health , wealth , and mobility , the opportunities , at declining <unk> .
there 's ever been a time , like this .
my <unk> died of as they were 60 .
my grandparents had urged her that number on 70 .
my parents are the 80 , into iraq .
there should so eloquently than a nine , my <unk> .
but it 's not time to people like us , because this is a lot more thing than that .
a kid , that today in delhi is born , it can expect , so long to live as the richest man on the 100 years ago .
think about it . that 's an amazing fact .
and why is that ?
the smallpox . the smallpox would have a billion people on this planet killed .
they have the demographics of the ground in a way to be shaped , it 's no war , ever done .
they 've gone . they have vanished .
we have you <unk> . go pfft .
in the rich world are diseases , the millions of us , just one generation , they have , not yet .
<unk> , <unk> , polio --
i know , even odder still have someone , which is ?
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability , billion people to feed , that are some successes the scientific method .
and from my perspective is the way , things out , look , if it works , it change , if it does n't that does , one of the greatest achievements of humanity .
so this is the good news .
unfortunately , that 's been around the good news , because there 's a few other problems , and they were often talk about it ,
and one of this is , despite all our greatest achievements a billion people in the world every day when to go down .
this number up , and they are rising very quickly , and that 's embarrassing .
and more than that , we have our imagination used to , this world that we had to your choice .
drinking water , <unk> country , the rainforests , oil , gas , they disappear , and it soon , and if we 're not from this chaos <unk> go so we also .
so the question is : we can do that ? i think it .
i think it 's clear , that we food can produce , the billion people on average will never , this country , they live , to rape her .
i think , we can take this world with the power , that you do n't both being destroyed .
i think that really , and no , this is not thinking .
but this is holding me to wake up -- one of the things , the me to wake up to hold . we 've been progress . it 's never really needed , like now , still never ,
and we were also still never in the position , it as <unk> , as we it today .
we 're at the threshold to see , astonishing design events in many places . and yet i really , that we needed hundreds , 300 years ago , the enlightenment . go back to , to a time to find , in the we made this thing about have , in the we about these things <unk> <unk> have to more found myself as now .
the people putting yourself to in their faith , which is so closely , that you have n't release .
not conveyed , the truth will they free .
and they stop , everybody has a right on their opinion , ; even a right on their opinion , for progress ,
but you know , what they do n't quite have ?
they have no right on their own facts . <unk> , you have n't .
and i have a while it , to this out .
now , for about a decade , i was a piece of vaccination , `` the new yorker , '' written , a small paper .
and i was amazed , on the resistance to bump , on the resistance to the , which the most effective activity in health in the history of humanity .
i did n't know , what i should do , so i did just what i always doing , i wrote a paper and i went on .
and soon after that i wrote a paper about <unk> changed the food .
the same thing , only bigger .
the people were getting crazy .
so i also about one articles written , and i could n't understand , why the people thought , that would `` <unk> '' , why they thought , that the molecules on a certain type of a random jumble of move a <unk> on the area of nature .
but you know , i do what do . i wrote the articles , i 'm going .
i mean , i am foremost journalist ,
we have to type , we can take a , we go food , that 's okay .
but these articles were made me worried , and i could n't figure out , why , and eventually i found it turns out .
and this is , it 's this <unk> , the me nuts were doing it does n't <unk> .
that were <unk> people , educated people , decent people .
they were just like the people in this room .
and that got me so what i ...
but then i thought , you know what , are we 're honest .
we 're on a point where , in which we 're not just the same relationship to the progress , how much earlier .
we 're talking <unk> .
we talk to be ironic that , with a little quotes about , `` forward . ''
okay , that there 's reasons , and i think we know , which is a reason that are .
we have this faith in institutions , in the authority , and sometimes in the science at the lost , and there 's no reason why do n't that it should be .
you can just a couple of names we call , and the people will understand .
chernobyl , <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> , mass destruction , the <unk> 2000 .
i mean , you know , you can your list your vote .
there 's ask , and problems with the people , of which we thought , that they always right have . let 's say , they 're skeptical .
imagine if you ask , for you have evidence , for you some evidence .
they take nothing as well .
but now here 's : if you have evidence to get you have this evidence to assume , and in that we 're not good .
and i can that 's from the reason to say , that we now in an epidemic of fear for life , i they still never seen have and hopefully will never see again .
now , for about 12 years was a story posted , a terrible story , the <unk> with the <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> vaccine appeared in the connection .
very scary .
lots of studies have been done to see , if that 's true .
lots of studies we should be done ; this is a serious business .
the data came in .
the data came in , from the united states , from england , from sweden , from canada , and they were all right , no significant correlation , no link , it 's not .
it does n't matter . it does n't matter , because we looked at , anecdotal , believe , we think , what we see , what we need to see believe , what does , that we really feel .
we do n't think about a bunch of documents from a <unk> , of us data , there , and i do that , i think that do we all .
but you know what ?
the result of it was a little bit catastrophic ,
catastrophic , because of the fact , the u.s. is one of the only countries in the world , in the immunization , <unk> down .
that 's absolutely scandalous outrage , and we should be ashamed .
it 's awful .
what happened , that we could do .
well , i understand that . i 'm doing that .
because it has anybody here <unk> ?
has a single mountain in the audience ever get to <unk> to see ?
it 's not many times .
what happens in this country do n't actually , but the 160,000 time in the world in the last year .
that are many deaths made by <unk> , 20 per hour .
but because that 's not happening here is , we make this crowd , and people like jenny mccarthy , can run around and writing messages of fear and illiteracy is of the platforms like watching oprah and larry king live preach it .
and that you can do , because they cause and the correlation not connecting .
they do n't understand that these things does seem to be , but virtually never the same thing .
and this is something , that we need to learn world , which is very quickly .
this guy was a hero , jonas salk .
it liberated us by one of the worst <unk> of humanity .
not afraid , not a very matter-of-factly , polio , and then , gone .
the guy in the middle , not so much .
he called `` paul <unk> .
he has just with a few other people a <unk> .
he can the life of <unk> , a million children per year in the developing save .
well . not ?
so , that 's good , besides that , that 's walking around and over the vaccines , talking and says , how valuable they are , and that people just quit should be able to stay complaining .
and that says he actually so .
paul 's so a terrorist .
if paul charges in a public <unk> talks , he ca n't without fully armed foot on the speech .
he gets calls home , because the people to him to tell , that you know where his children go to school .
and why ? because it 's a vaccine that did .
i do n't need this say , but the vaccines are essential .
you take them on , let 's the disease , terrible disease , and this is happening now .
we have in this country now <unk> .
and this is worse , and pretty soon be kids back about dying , because that 's just a question the numbers .
and they 're not just to <unk> die .
what about polio ? we take this . why not ?
a <unk> of me has to me a few weeks ago , people and told you think i 'm a little to <unk> .
nobody has that ever said before .
they would their kid 's not against polio do . no means .
subtle .
why ? because we could n't see polio as adults . and you know what ?
we had in this country , who was n't see polio program .
now , i do n't know , maybe it does this morning is anyone in lagos , a plane and i 'm going on to go to los angeles , the moment he 's kind of ohio .
and in a few hours picking up he and <unk> a car , and he comes to long beach , and he 's one of <unk> <unk> tonight is to go .
and he does n't know , that it with a stock disease , and there is , and we know that 's not , because it works the world .
this is the planet , we live . they do n't so , as if he does this is .
we love it , us in a lie to membrane . we love this .
they have the morning is all their supply vitamins had taken ?
<unk> , a little <unk> , that you on the thing you can help .
i know , that they 've done , because half the americans , that every day .
you take this stuff , and you take an alternative to cure , and it does n't matter , how often we find out , that they 're useless .
the data , from the time .
they darkening them their urine . do more they almost never .
that 's okay , they want to be in 28 billion dollars for the dark , urine of numbers .
i agree with them completely .
in their urine . dark .
why we doing this ? why we doing this ?
well , i think , i understand -- we hate the pharma industry .
we hate each one to a strong government . we have n't trust the solar system .
and that we should also not . our healthcare system is miserable .
it 's cruel to millions of people .
it 's absolutely amazing cold and <unk> ourselves to us , that it can afford .
we go so that way , and where we walk , we ?
we walk in the the <unk> .
that 's fine . i love the <unk> .
but you know , this is really a serious business , because this stuff is crap , and we give billion dollars for me .
and i 've all kinds of a small , some here .
this does n't it -- <unk> , cheating , <unk> , cheating , <unk> , because i do n't know , what that is , but we give billion dollars for it out , it 's cheating .
and you know what ? when i 'm not saying that , shouting at me the people to be , and say , `` what does it you ? let the people , but do , anything you .
so you feel . ''
and you know what ? they 're wrong .
it because i don’t care is , whether it 's the health is , the fortuneteller says , `` huh , i 'm going to the evidence of experts to have n't suppose '' or any <unk> , of his patients with <unk> some guy wants .
if you try to on this way down , where i think , and magic of evidence and science to replace , get them at a place , in which they do n't want to be .
they get to thabo mbeki 's in south africa .
he got there have its people to make , because he said that was , that red <unk> , <unk> and <unk> much more than any antiretroviral drugs are , of which we know , you to the course of aids , braking .
hundreds undue death in a country , the worse than any other of this disease <unk> of .
you to tell me not that these things are no grave implications .
the have you . that they 've always .
now , the <unk> epidemic , in the we are at , is this ridiculous , struggle between the <unk> <unk> <unk> food and the <unk> .
this is a <unk> debate . they have to stop .
it 's a debate about the words , about metaphors .
that 's anti-israeli ideology , not science .
everything , what we eat , every <unk> , each branch <unk> , every brussels sprouts , was from the people changed .
you know , there 's no <unk> in the garden .
there 's no <unk> .
there 's no christmas . we have this all done .
we have it in the last thousand years .
and some of that has worked and some of it 's not .
we 're getting rid of going to do n't work .
now we go closer to do . and of course , there 's reckless risks . but we can do something like , vitamin a in rice , do , and this stuff can million people to help , million people , their lives to extend .
that you do n't want to do ?
i must say , that i do n't understand .
we refuse <unk> changed the food .
why we do that ?
now , what i always listening is : to a lot of chemicals , pesticides , hormones , <unk> , we 're not a huge areas with one thing , that 's wrong .
we do n't want , that companies in the patent .
we do n't want , that companies seeds have .
and you know what my answer on all this is ?
yes , they are right . fix this , we .
it 's true , we have a <unk> , but that 's not science .
that has to science is nothing to do .
it 's right , right now , <unk> .
you know , the science does n't company is .
she 's no country .
she 's not conveyed , an idea ; she 's a process .
she 's a process , and sometimes work , he and sometimes not , but the idea , that we the science is not allow us to , their work to do , because we 're afraid of is a really dead , and they 're holding the millions of people from the great flourishing .
you know , in the next 50 years we 're going to 70 percent more than growing food than we have the moment . 70 percent .
this investment in africa in the last 30 years .
embarrassing . embarrassing .
they need that , and we give it would n't tell you .
and why ? <unk> changed the food .
we want people do n't be empowered , this <unk> stuff to eat , like <unk> .
<unk> is something , that half a billion people eat .
it 's about how a potato .
it 's just a bunch of calories . it 's miserable .
it has n't require nutrients , it has no one protein , and scientists to build all that they 're looking at a .
and then you might be the people that food and would n't think there are .
they would n't starving , and you know what ?
that would you . it would n't <unk> <unk> , but it would you .
and everything , what i say to be here is : why are we do this ?
i mean , we ask : why are we do this ?
because we 're not genes <unk> want ?
it 's not about , gene to move . it 's not to chemicals .
it 's not about our ridiculous passion for our hormones , our persist in greater our food , better food , act at food .
it 's not to rice <unk> , it 's about , people on your life to get , and it 's not our first time , to understand what that means .
because you know what ?
if we do n't do it , if we so on doing as far do we 're looking at a little bit guilty , in which we , i believe , not guilty to be , high-tech colonialism .
there 's no other description for that , what happened here .
it 's acting selfish , it 's ugly , it 's our not worthy , and we have this really stop them .
after this incredible funny , entertainment , to say , they might say , you still in this ridiculous time and in the future to go ? ''
, sure . that i want , sure .
now , there 's them in the present , but we have an incredible opportunity .
we can take this time on all imagine , what we want .
we can you 're moving , where we they 're moving to , and we 're going to go to move , where we want .
we have these conversations have , and we need to think , but if we 're in the time up and in the future , we will be happy to be , that made more .
i know , that we do it can , and as it me in this is something that the world needs now .
thank you .
thank you .
for some time , i 've come for the <unk> . it might seem curious , that , a magician interested in that , it because , you look at it as i , `` a deception , the to a real space is , if someone just , enough that thinks . ''
other words , <unk> have in some studies have a measurable effect that , the <unk> , which is just so , because the person thinks , with her is happening , is a pharmaceutical facilities , or a kind of -- in <unk> , for example , there 's , if the patient 's only , enough that thinks , a measurable effect of the body , that you the <unk> called .
a delusion is going to a real , because somebody 's so the world .
so that we 're also understanding , i want you now a basic , very trick .
and i 'll tell you , and it works . this is a trick , the least for the 1950s , in every <unk> for children .
i even have taught him from <unk> <unk> magic of <unk> in the 1970s , learned .
i 'm going to him for them out and it , and explain .
and then i 'm going to explain , why i told him , let me .
so , you see what happens .
that knife , that they 're able ; my hand , that they do .
i 'm that knife . just like in my off to hold .
i do you my sleeve , back .
and to make sure that , nothing in my sleeve away , or from him out , i 'll just my wrist on right here <unk> .
this way , you can see that it no time , you move . long as i 'm here <unk> , can not in my sleeve , as it or out .
and the goal of it is very simple .
i 'm going to my hand up , and hopefully , if everything goes well , is that knife by my bare physical , magnetics ago .
it sits actually so , at its place , that i do it shake it , without that knife falls off .
nothing goes in my sleeve , or it comes out , no <unk> . and you can all study .
<unk> .
well , this is a trick , which i was a little kids to bring out , the , for magic that interest , because you can do this very much about deception to learn , if you look closely , although it 's a very simple <unk> trick is .
probably know many of them in this room that trick .
he works like this .
i think that knife in the hand .
i say , that i my wrist <unk> , to make sure that , nothing in my sleeve away , or out , and this is a lie .
the reason , why i my wrist <unk> , is the , in that , the real secret of illusion is .
moment , which , where i mean by hand of you <unk> , with them back of see , moves , of hands on here , my <unk> , just from there , where it was , in a position , in the he was about this extended .
wonderful trick ?
back there 's got someone , the not a childhood had .
so , he 's going to start here . right .
and when i 'm <unk> , changing the hands on its position .
and now you could talk about , why that a delusion is , why you do n't have facial , that there , i just three fingers to see are , because the mind and the way , he 's information into , they 're not one that matter , one , two , three , but they make a group can see .
but that 's now here 's not actually , and then i open , i mean by hand .
of course it will there would have no , but not by the magnetics my body , but by a trick , through my <unk> , the right now there is .
and when i mean by hand , let me , that on the same thing , i <unk> , going through this movement actually , that the finger , again <unk> .
i 'll use these hand away . and there is the knife .
this trick , they can your friends and i used to demonstrate . thanks .
now , what has this with the <unk> to do ?
one year ago , or so , i read a study , that i 'm really right away .
i 'm not a doctor or scientists , and so i was that for me an amazing thing .
it has , which is what turned out , if you a <unk> in the form a white or so there , in the form of a <unk> , is that just a round , white or so , the one of measurable effect .
but if you the shape , in the you that <unk> people , for example , in a smaller pill to change , and these blue color and a letter that , cloaking them , is they actually a measurable more .
and that , no matter of any of pharmaceutical facilities -- it are just <unk> .
but a white or so is not as well as a blue pill .
what ? that made me really crazy .
it was wondering , but it , that still not it 's .
if you capsules as we know , , the people are still more than lots and every form .
a colored the capsule , the at one end of yellow and the red is , is better than a white capsule .
also the <unk> plays a role .
a pill twice a day is not as well as three pills -- i ca n't go into now at the exact statistics , remember . i do , i 'm sorry .
the really , but is , ...
... that 's also the <unk> play a role .
and the shape is paramount .
and if you the ultimate <unk> have to , you have to the needle in your grasp .
right ? a syringe with a <unk> -- a few <unk> a <unk> substance , that you a patient gets into .
this is a very strong brand image in mind . that 's very much more than a white pill .
this chart is really -- i 'm going to you in a different times show , if we have a <unk> .
the fact , is , the white or so not so well , it looks like the blue pill , that are not good , it looks like a cramped capsule , that are not good , it looks like the needle .
and none of has some really not pharmaceutical property . it 's only way we believe it , the in us a greater impact -- and .
i want to know , if i did this idea for a magic trick could use .
i suspect something that , obviously a delusion is , and let 's really look .
we know , out at the study , you to look at the needle to grab , if it on the thing to go to .
this is one of an inch long <unk> . she 's very , <unk> . and i 'm going to you first a little bit to render time .
this is really my meat . it 's not <unk> special <unk> meat .
this is my skin . that is no special from hollywood .
i 'm now this needle in my skin and bite through them up , until you on the other , hard hats .
if you something is -- if they easily in famished and fall -- i started this a few friends , the last night in the hotel room , demonstrated , and some people , that i did n't know , and it 's a woman , faint .
i 'm so , if you very bad will , then you looking for the next 30 seconds away . or , you know what , i 'm going to the first <unk> part back here .
you can it 'll see , you can but also <unk> , if you want .
so , it goes like , right here , where my it starts , the bottom of my <unk> i 'll just a small one puncture , do .
, you know i really sorry . makes you go crazy ?
and now just a little bit through my skin and the other so back out .
now we 're actually in the same situation , that we do the <unk> .
about .
but now you can of my fingers do n't count , right ?
so , when i do you show you . this is one , two , three , four , five .
well ,
i know , what the people think , if you see that .
they say , `` okay , the 's certainly not so stupid and <unk> to itself the skin , just to us for a few minutes to talk . ''
now , then i 'm going to show you .
look like this from ? well .
, i know .
and the people back to say , `` okay . i think that 's not right . ''
the people in the <unk> are now in .
you make it was to them from the near me show .
this is really my skin . that is no special from hollywood .
this is my meat , and i can that 's swivel around .
i do , i 'm sorry . if you something is , you look away , you look not .
now , the back or the it later , eventually , on video to see , will say , `` well , see that , yes , fairly impressive , but if it really would , he would -- you see here 's a hole and there , if it really would , it would we bleed . ''
okay , let me give you have a bit of blood for you <unk> .
yes , it is .
normally would i now the needle and take too .
i would have an oil and show you , that 's not the wounds .
but i think , in this framework , here and with the intention , from a deception that 's going to do , i 'm going to the needle . just in there 's , and so from the stage .
we are in the next days . it was a few times its face .
i hope , you 'll be wondering , already on . thanks .
everybody talks about today about happiness . .
i have some people at the number of books are now , the , `` <unk> '' in the title , in the last five years or published by and they gave after about 40 , and there 's still much more .
there 's a massive wave of interest to be under the explorers .
there 's very much <unk> .
everybody wanted to look at the people are happier lives .
but despite all of tide of work , there 's several different cognitive fall , that 's sort of almost impossible to do , clear about happiness might think .
and my talk today is mainly from these cognitive map into action .
this is for reporter , the of their own happiness might think , and it is for scientists , the about happiness might think , because , it turns out , that we just like this is what are like everyone else .
the first of the meeting is a <unk> , complexity of admit that .
it turns to start out , that word that happiness is simply not a useful in the word is far more , because we it on to all of how to work .
i think , there 's one of themselves , on the we it just to be , and large , like this is something , that we give up to be , and we 're going to the complicated , which you would have to , what well-being is .
the second case is one of experience and memory , in basically consists of them between be happy in his life and be happy about his life , or happy with his life .
and that are two very different ideas , and they 're both <unk> in the idea of happiness .
and the third is the <unk> , and that 's unfortunate the fact , that we 're not about a way to think , the well-being of all , without its importance to warp .
i mean , this is a cognitive and trap .
there 's simply no way , it right to get .
now i 'd like with an example , of someone , the one <unk> had to one of my lectures , the a story told . [ unclear ... '' ] , he said , he had a symphony heard , and it was absolutely beautiful music , and the very end of this , there 's a <unk> <unk> sound .
and then on it 's add , really quite emotionally , that has the whole experience ever ruined .
but that i did n't .
what it ruined had were the memories , at the experience .
he had the experience of out .
he had 20 minutes <unk> music had .
you care , not because it with a memory <unk> was ; the memory that was ruined , and the memory that was all , what he goes to keep getting .
what we actually says is , we of us and over the other people think we could in terms of two kinds of themselves .
there 's a <unk> myself , that in the present to live and the presence today knows , is able , the past , back to experience , but basically , just the present .
it 's the <unk> myself , that the doctor <unk> -- you know , if the doctor , asks : `` do now it hurts , when i do you here <unk> ? ''
and then there 's a <unk> myself , and that <unk> itself is this , <unk> and the story of life going to get , and it 's your teammates , that the doctor 's been by it 's the question is , `` how do you have to it lately , felt like ? ''
or `` how was their journey to albania ? '' or a similar .
that are two very different entities , that <unk> ourselves and that <unk> myself , and the two to confuse this is part of <unk> of exploring the lucky .
so , that <unk> itself is a storyteller .
and that is really begin with a basic reaction in our memories . '' -- it begins immediately .
we tell you 're not just a story , when we think about how do , stories to tell .
our memory , tells us stories , that is , what we of our experiences , who would get to 's a story .
and let them <unk> with an example start .
there 's an old study .
that are real patients , the , a painful procedure in .
i 'm not going into some details . you today is not anymore , but it does it was painful , as this study in the 1990s , did .
they were asked , everybody loses 60 seconds about their pain to cover .
and here are two patients . that are your records .
and they 're asking : `` who of these people has more suffered ? ''
and that 's a very simple question .
a b has the more suffered . his <unk> was no longer , and every minute of pain , the patient is a , had had a b , and more .
but now there 's a different question : `` how very thought that these patients , that they had suffered ? ''
and here 's a surprise .
and the surprise is , the patient is a in a lot <unk> <unk> at the <unk> had a patient to b .
the stories of <unk> were different , and because a very , so in part of the story is , how they turned out --
and no one of these stories is very <unk> or a great -- but one of them is this shows ...
but one of them is much worse than the other .
and the , the worse is it , where the pain of the end on his point was . it 's a bad history .
where we know that ?
because we all these people after their <unk> ask you have , and as much later , `` how bad was the whole thing in general ? `` well ,
and she was much worse for a , as to b in the <unk> .
well , this is a direct conflict between the <unk> ourselves and the <unk> itself .
of view of <unk> even had to b is a <unk> time .
now , what you with the patient is a , he could do , and we 've actually now done experiments , and it 's been done , and it works , you could actually the <unk> of the patient is a to increase by showing you just the hose in it makes no to very likely to him to up .
this is going to result , that the patient is suffering , but only a little bit and much less than before .
and if you do that for a few minutes has power you can just thought that <unk> ourselves from the patient is a worse off is , and you has dominated by , that <unk> ourselves from the patient is a lot better put there is , because now you have the patient is a in a story about his experience , there .
but what 's being a story from ?
and this is for the stories , the the memory of us , of the and it 's also for the stories , that we invent .
what did a story i think are these cases , great moments , and the end .

so , that <unk> even live his life and ill-defined .
it has moments of <unk> , one after the other .
and they ask : what happens with these moments ?
and the answer is really simple . they are , lost .
i mean , the most of moments of life -- and i do that does -- you know , the psychological present the other than about three seconds long . which means , you know that , in a life about 600 million of there . in a month there 's about 600,000 , the most of you can do n't a trail .
the most of you can be completely ignored by the <unk> itself .
and yet you get kind of the idea is , they had that should , that what happens during these moments of <unk> happening in our lives .
it 's the limited resource , that we use as we 're in the world .
and how we they say they would seem to be important , but that 's not the story , the <unk> ourselves to we keep .
so we do this <unk> ourselves and that <unk> myself , and they 're really quite different .
the biggest difference between them is the people interact with time .
of view of <unk> myself , if you a vacation . and the second one week , that 's good as the first , is the <unk> 's twice as well as the <unk> vacation .
so that 's not calling for the <unk> itself .
for the <unk> itself is a <unk> vacation 's better than the <unk> on , because there is no new memories , which i 'd be .
they have the story does n't changed .
and this way is time , on the variable , the a <unk> itself is different from a <unk> itself . time has a very profound impact on this story .
so , that <unk> itself is more , as to remember , and stories to tell .
it 's your teammates , that choice is true , because if you a patient who have , the , we say , two <unk> at two different surgeons did and to decide , which he would choose to , is the , the votes of , the memory that has , the less bad news is , and this is the surgeon , the selected will .
this <unk> itself has no voice in this choice .
so we choose not between these are . we choose between the memories . their experiences .
and even if we looked at the future , think we need to take our future would not as such thing .
we think about our future , as <unk> memories .
but basically , can you look at , you know , as a tyranny of <unk> myself , and you can the <unk> even think more than one , this sort of this <unk> even <unk> through experience , the <unk> themselves do n't need .
i have the sense , that if we started going to do this very often the case is , that is , we make a vacation largely sitting in a little bottle of <unk> itself .
and that 's a little bit hard to justify punishment , i think .
i mean , very <unk> we of our memories ?
this is one of explanations , the for the dominance of <unk> even gave it .
and when i think about , i think about a vacation trip , we a few years ago in antarctica . 've done , the at the best on was , which i ever had , and i think quite often it relates to the tools that , how often i 'm going to other <unk> think .
and i 've probably from my memory of these <unk> journey , i 'd say about 25 minutes long in the last four years <unk> .
now , when i ever the folder open , you have to the 600 million pictures that i would have another one hour spent .
so , that are three weeks , and that are probably its half hours .
because it seems a disagreement , to do .
now , i like a little extremely be , you know , it , how little appetite , i on the <unk> of memories of have , but myself , if you more of doing there 's a real question . why we give memories so much weight in <unk> to the weight , that we these are there ?
so i want , that you about a thought experiment to think .
imagine if you try to their next on , you know , that the end of <unk> all their pictures are going and they get a <unk> drug , so that to do n't remember .
now , you were the same to vote ?
and if you a different to vote would , there 's a conflict between her two kinds of ourselves and they have to think about , as you this conflict to decide , and this is really does not obvious , because if you in terms of time thinking they get an answer . and if you in terms of memory to think you could one another answer .
why we the <unk> choose , that we do is a problem , that we have to us turns out with a choice between the two kinds of themselves .
now , the two kinds of ourselves into two words from happiness .
there 's actually two concepts of happiness , that we can use , one per second self .
so they can ask : how happy , is that <unk> ourselves ?
and then they would ask : how happy there are those moments in life of <unk> ourselves ?
and they are all -- fortunately for those moments , is a fairly complicated process .
what are the emotions , the measured it can be ?
and , the way , we 're now capable of a pretty good idea to get the luck of <unk> ourselves over the time .
if you after the luck of <unk> yourself questions , it 's a very different thing .
this is not about it , as happy one person who lives .
it 's kind of information , as happy or where is that person , if this person about their lives , it .
very different .
everybody , of those terms n't really different is the study of happiness up , and i belong to a lot of explorers of well-being , the study of happiness have just blew have on exactly that way .
the distinction between the luck of <unk> ourselves and the average happiness of <unk> itself is in the last few years , actually been , and now , which you , the individual .
the <unk> organization has a global survey , the more than a people ask , i 've been are about , what you about her life thinking and about their experiences . and there 's another group effort in the direction .
in the last years , we 've so , about happiness . the two kinds of myself better .
and the main one lesson , that we , i believe we 've learned is , they really differently .
you know , as happy somebody with his life is , and that teaches you really not a lot about , as happy , he compartmentalizes his life living and vice versa .
just to make them a sense of the correlation to convey , the correlation and it 's about <unk> .
what this is , whenever you would meet and you would tell you , oh , his father 's a <unk> , how much would you about his greatness all know ?
well , they would do something about his greatness all know , but there 's much uncertainty .
they have so much uncertainty .
when i tell them , that somebody his life than eight on a scale from 10 <unk> has you have much uncertainty about , as happy , he 's with his <unk> itself .
the correlation is so low .
we know about something , what the average happiness of <unk> .
we know , that money is very important , goals are very important .
we know , that happiness , basically means , very pleased to be with people , that we like , time to spend with people , that we like .
there 's other occupational pleasure , but this is a dominant society .
so if you that happiness , the two kinds of ourselves to maximize that we want you going to the end very different things to do .
the implication of anyway , what i 'm here said , to have is , we 've been really not going to be as a substitute for well-being .
it 's a completely different .
now , very quickly , a another reason , from the we 're not clear about happiness might think we can is , we 're not on the same things look if we talk about the life thinking and if we actually life .
so if you the easy to ask , as happy the people in california are you will not the correct answer .
if you ask this question you think , that people in california , happy to be if you , we say , in ohio gave life .
and what happens is , if you about that live in california to think , you think about the difference between california , and other places , and that difference is , we say , in climate .
well , it turns to start out , that climate is not very important for the <unk> itself is , and it 's not even very important for the thoughtful about ourselves , that will decide , as happy people are .
but now , because the thoughtful about yourself responsible is , you get to the end -- some people might the end to california .
and it 's sort of interesting to track , what happens with people , the to california , pull in the hope , happier .
now , you <unk> themselves will not happy .
we know that .
but one thing will happen . they 're thinking , that you happier lives are , because if you think about you will of it will , how awful the weather in ohio . and they 're going to feel , you to the right decision , i met .
it 's very hard , clear about well-being of thinking , and i hope , i gave you a sense of doing , how hard it is .
thank you .
thank you . i have a question .
thank you .
now , when we had a few weeks ago , on 've talked about them to me , that 's a pretty interesting is there , this out of these <unk> poll was .
this is something , what you to participate let you can , because they now a few minutes left would have ?
daniel <unk> : sure .
i think , the most astonishing result , that we in the <unk> survey found have is a number , that we absolutely not to find that we did .
we found that in terms of happiness . of <unk> itself .
if we were , emotions with the income <unk> .
and it turns to start out , that under a guaranteed income of 60,000 dollars per year , for americans , and that 's a very large sample of americans , about 600,000 , but it 's a great representative sample , under a guaranteed income of 600,000 dollars in the year .
60,000 years .
dk : look .
60,000 dollars in the year are the people getting unhappy , and they are increasingly less happy , the poorer . they 're going .
that we get an absolutely flat line .
i mean , i 've ever so flat lines .
and what happens is obviously , that money , no <unk> we bought , but that lack of money , certainly do we bought , and we can that we do very , it can measure .
in terms of the other self , of <unk> myself , you get another story .
the more money you deserve more work is you .
this is not for emotion .
but danny , in the entire american now it 's going to live , freedom , the quest for happiness .
when people that makes take seriously , would , i mean , it all the head to ask , everything , what we think , for example , in terms of policy and so forth .
there 's a chance , that politicians , that the country in general one that finding out how the take seriously , would and based on politics , would make us ?
dk : you know , i think that , recognition , there for the role <unk> in the policy .
the recognition is slow to be in the united states , no question , but the uk does that you just and in other countries that happens , they 're .
the people are , recognizing that you to happiness might think should , you look at the political thinking .
it will be a while , and the people will discuss them , if you <unk> explore , or whether they <unk> exploring those cases , and so we have this debate pretty soon .
how you 're lucky because it 's very differently depending upon it , as you think and if you at the <unk> even think , or whether they 're looking at the <unk> even think .
this is politics are , i think in the next few years .
in the united states <unk> you , that <unk> the population .
this is , i think in the next a or two decades of the national statistics .
now , it strikes me , this is subject , or should at least the most important political debate to set up to be about the next few years .
thank you for the invention of behavioral economics .
thank you , danny <unk> .
i 'm watching jane mcgonigal , i design games .
i think now for 10 years that online . and my goal for the next decade is , it was as easy to do , the world in the reality to save , as you in <unk> to save .
i have a design for . i want more people do , including you all , more time with the play more and <unk> games to spend .
now we spend three billion hours per week with <unk> .
some of you might think , `` this is a lot of this time for games . ''
maybe something to kind of time , when you think about how many problems we desperately in the real world to solve .

three billion hours per week are n't even close enough , to the most of the world to solve .
in fact , i am convinced that , if we have the next century on this planet to survive to , we have this time to dramatically increase .
i figured out , that required at age 21 billion hours <unk> per week is .
this appears first maybe something <unk> , so again , i do it , so it would do you ca : if we have issues like hungry , poverty , climate change , global conflict and obesity want to solve , i believe we have to try to play online for one or 21 billion hours per week from the end of the next decade to play .
no , i mean it really seriously .
why ? this is quite right , why i think , games to be so critical for survival of the human species in the future . seriously .
this is a her of photographers <unk> <unk> .
he wanted to the feelings to play catch . so he has , the players have a camera around .
this is one of the classic affinity groups of the play .
if they did n't want gamers are , we think , you might be some of nuances . in this picture .
you probably this sense of urgency , something , but also not fret and concentration , it would one in the problems of a really tough problem .
if you also play , you see some of nuances . here , the , <unk> eyes and the mouth that are a sign of teenage optimism . the eyebrows down to surprise .
this is a player , the edge of so-called distilled victory .
oh , you know that . ok , well . so we have some outstanding players , here .
a <unk> the force is a result , that goes extremely positive is , they had n't know , that 's possible .
it was almost smoke , beyond the imagination .
and if you do it , they 're shocked , that they actually going to that are . this is a <unk> victory .
this player 's just a distilled the victory .
and this is it , what we on millions of their faces of <unk> in the world you have , if we the barriers brought the next century in attacking . but the other , the a sense of all odds , the edge of distilled victory .
well , unfortunately , we see more of the face in real life , if we difficult problems with over .
i call it as the `` in life , i 'm a bad '' <unk> . and it 's actually my face , you see ? yes , ok .
that i am , as i thought that `` in life , i 'm a bad '' <unk> do .
this is a graffiti -- in my former head home in berkeley , california where i in my ph.d. studying , why we in games are better than in real life .
that 's a problem , that many player .
we think , that we in the reality is not so well , are like in games .
and i 'm not only eat fewer truck successfully , though that it .
we reach in <unk> more . i mean , in the relationship with the motivation , something meaningful to do , inspired to deal with each other .
if we 're in a <unk> are , i believe that many of us , in the best we 'll turn them , anytime and immediately helpful to are , you 're the problem to try , so long as you need , it after the failure , again to taste .
and in the reality , if we fail , if we 're going on the barriers to hit , feel we often different .
we feel overwhelmed . we are so well . we feel threatened , perhaps most depressed , frustrated , or <unk> .
these feelings , we 've never , if we play games , in games , there 's just they do n't .
and this is it , what i 'm a student to look at .
why is it in games are impossible , to think , you could n't simply reach it all ?
how we can these feelings of the play in the reality is ?
so i looked at games like the world of warcraft , that the ideals that environment for , made a problem solving it .
and i have some things i realized , the epic wins , <unk> so we can do .
so , first , if you in one of online games come into this , especially in the world of warcraft , there 's a lot of characters , that are willing , you a <unk> mission <unk> , and it now .
but not just some of the mission , but a mission , the perfect , to her current level of the game that well , right ?
so they make this .
they have no one task , that you ca n't solve .
but always the edge of their skills , so you have to work . but there 's no unemployment in the world of warcraft .
you is not around and around the lob , there 's always very specific and something important to do .
and there 's plenty of staff .
where they also go , hundreds of people , that engage with you , to their epic mission was in one .
that we have in real life , not so easy , this sense , that at a <unk> of people willing to stand .
also , there 's this epic story , this inspiring story , why we 're there and what we have to do .
then we can get this whole positive feedback .
they have are lots of `` level up '' and `` plus-one strength , '' or heard `` plus-one emotional intelligence . ''
this constant , feedback , there 's not in real life .
if i do this stage was leaving , i did n't , plus-one talk , and plus-one crazy idea , <unk> crazy idea .
i get in real life that feedback .
so , the problem <unk> the world of warcraft , is , it that satisfaction is , anytime , the edge of distilled victory to stand , that we prefer our whole time in these <unk> spend .
they 're just better than the reality .
to have all the world of <unk> together <unk> million years trying to , the virtual problems of <unk> to solve .
this is not necessarily something bad .
it might sound bad .
but to it 's , in context to see , ago <unk> million years , began our first <unk> going to go .
the first upright became good primate .
ok , so if we talk about , how much time we currently going to play on , does that just a sense , when you the time in the scale of human development , are holding , which is .
but also be appropriate . because it . out , that we , we all of this time to play using , actually changing this , what we as people in the able to .
we 're making us to all business , very much beings .
that 's the truth . that i believe .
at once they this thing about statistics , the recent graduating from a researcher at the carnegie mellon university was published , the average young man of today , in a country with strong <unk> spend 10,000 hours with <unk> to the 21st century . age .
so , 10,000 hours , is a very interesting number , from two reasons :
first again , for children in the united states are <unk> hours of the exact <unk> , that they 're looking at school , on , of the fifth . class , until the end of the high school -- if you never been missing .
so we have here , a complete <unk> , on the young people just learning , what it , a good i 'd want to be , like anything other , what they 're looking at school to learn .
and may have some of them the new book of malcolm gladwell , `` <unk> '' , read .
so you know of his theory of success , the theory of success of 10,000 hours .

we are so good at , '' which has always going to do , like the most people the world .
so , what we have here , is a complete generation of young people , the <unk> .
the big question is so , `` what exactly are are really good ? ''
because if we do it out how could , we have to sort of that i 've never been there <unk> human potential to spend .
so many people we 've now , in the world , the least an hour a day with <unk> spend .
that are our <unk> . 500 million people , the extraordinarily well , `` something '' are .
and the next decade we have another one billion players , the extraordinarily well , what 's also always .
you who 's still not have heard ,
the industry that <unk> , the energy to save and on <unk> work , instead of <unk> , so players around the world , especially in india , china , brazil , online games .
you 're expecting an extra one billion player in the next decade .
so we have total of 1.5 billion player .
so i started , to think , what it is , at us these games to anybody coming .
here are the four things that i found . , first , <unk> .
ok , imagine if you like the extreme <unk> ago .
<unk> is that urge , right to do something , a challenge to anybody coming , together with the believe that we have a <unk> hope spots on success .
i believe , it , that a <unk> the force is possible , and that it 's still worth , it to try , which is the same .
are not sit around .
are masters in spiders a social nets .
there 's a lot more research , the show , that we are more like , after we with you 've been playing , even if you to the ills of the defeated correctly .
the reason for this is , it 's a lot of trusting too requires , with somebody a game to play .
we rely on , that somebody time with us to spend , the rules <unk> be , that we did the goal , and to the end of it .
so the technologies that we see that in sort of ties , trust and other .
as a result of that we build their social relations .
<unk> productivity . fantastic !
you know , there 's a reason , why the <unk> of <unk> 22 hours per week he plays , as <unk> .
the reason is , , if we play , we 're actually be happier , too hard to work , as if we wanted to relax , or do nothing .
we know , that we as human beings that can work , if we make hard , actually work done .
and are always ready , hard to work , if you the task .
and ultimately , very epic , meaning .
players love it , part of awe <unk> missions <unk> eliminated .
here 's a <unk> , to that the right light to back . you are lots of wikipedia , the wiki .
the largest wiki the world , almost over 80,000 entries that is the world of warcraft , a wiki .
five million people use it every month .
they have more information about the world of warcraft , the things as of some other issue in each other wiki .
they create a very epic story .
they create a very epic source of knowledge about the world of warcraft .
ok , that are so four superpowers , the to a single product of lives . are <unk> , hopeful individuals .
it are people , the believe that you as individual can change the world .
and the only problem is , you believe , you can the virtual worlds to change , but not the real .
this is the problem , that i 'm going to try .
edward <unk> is a <unk> .
his work is awesome . he looked at , why people that much time , energy and money in <unk> spend .
and he says , `` we 're going to witness of not less than a <unk> in virtual worlds , and <unk> . ''
and that from an economist . so he 's obvious .
and he says ...
not like i -- i think of games , i 'm a <unk> .
so he says , that you odd fact , in the sense player can in <unk> achieve more than in real life .
you can in games in their social ties with each other than in real life . they get more valuable feedback and rewards in games than in real life .
so , he says , it 's currently , perfect sense , that are more time in the virtual world as in the real time .
i agree that first time to , it makes sense .
but it 's definitely not <unk> .
we need to start , the real world in a game to turn them .
my whole inspiration comes from an event , the 2,500 years of shared .
there 's this ancient cube , from <unk> . you know ?
now , for these fantastic sketch it was <unk> .
and that were sort of the first of humans evolved <unk> .
and if you with the mechanics of the ancient greek <unk> <unk> 're familiar , you know , maybe this story . the story about , and why games .
according <unk> were playing games , more <unk> , the bamum kingdom <unk> during a famine invented .
we think there 's such a great famine , that the king of <unk> to a crazy idea of his .
the people who suffered . the people fought side .
it was an extreme situation . you needed an extreme solution .
so they invented , according <unk> , that <unk> and agreed to a national strategy . on a day would you eat . the next day you would play .
and they were as much in the <unk> would one be , games , so we are and us to satisfying to , <unk> productivity by water , that you remember that would , that 's nothing to eat , there .
and then , the next day you would play . and the next day would you eat .
and according <unk> allowing them so for 18 years that famine , by them on a day and eat and the next was playing .
as well , i do we use today , games .
we put play a , to the suffering from the real world to get away .
we put play a , to all due to think , that in the real world 's not work , everything that in real life , not of satisfaction is , and we bring us what we need from the play .
but that does n't have to the end .
that 's exciting .
according <unk> was to 18 years , the famine is not better . so i decided to the king , a final <unk> that we need .
they did this kingdom , in two halves .
they played a <unk> and the winner boxes on to a distilled the adventure to break it .
they were coming out <unk> and made of the quest for a new home . they were just so many people , how it food to survive there and looking to the rest for an area , in the they are able to .
this sounds crazy , ?
but the latest <unk> show , the <unk> , the later this remotely muddied got up , the same dna as the old <unk> one .
so i came together scientists recently to the notion that <unk> ' crazy story actually true .
and we geologists found evidence of a global cooling , the almost 20 years of it , what the famine years to be .
so i could take these crazy story of voices .
you might have actually their people through play rescued , to do for 18 years in games , escaped and , and then this intuition was and so much about that playing with each other learned is , they provided by the whole civilization have saved .
so , that we can also .
we 're playing , since 1994 warcraft .
it was the first <unk> in the world of <unk> . that was 16 years ago .
they played for 18 years <unk> , we play for 16 years of warcraft .
i 'd like , we 're ready for our own <unk> game .
so , they sent the half of civilization depended on the quest for a new world . so i mean , 21 billion <unk> per week .

i know , they 're going to ask : `` how we 're solving problems of the real world in games ? '' and that particular question i mean work in the last few years at the center for the future to exacerbate .
we have this banner , in our office in palo alto , it push from the way we 're going to be .
we do n't want to try , the future we had to say .
what we want , is the future to create .
we want to the best results , imagine . and then people to powerful , this idea in the reality of doing .
we imagine epic wins , and give people the possibilities , you to achieve .
i 'll show you very quickly . three games , that i designed to have to try , people that epic wins in their own future to give yourself .
this is `` the world without oil . ''
this game is of 2007 .
it 's a <unk> . you a <unk> get to .
the <unk> 's invented , but we have enough <unk> , so it for them , it 's and you very real life , without oil life . so , if you try to the game register , they tell us , where they live . and then get them <unk> in real , the show you , how much oil costs , what 's not there , like food security with is , as transportation , with is , whether school closed organizations are , whether it in the there . and they have to figure out , you very real life make , if it 's true if it . and we ask them , about to blog , high-speed videos or a scanner , your work .
we have this game with <unk> players in 2007 , and tested . and we have you ever since over the last three years , too .
and i tell you , it was a changing the experience .
nobody wants to life change , because it 's good for the environment is , or because we it should .
but if you , distilled adventures are and told you get , `` us about the oil . ''
this is a fascinating about adventure , on that you go .
they find out , how they were going to . the most of gamers have the game <unk> habits that .
so we 've gone for the next <unk> play a bigger , at the vision into than just <unk> .
we have this game , `` <unk> '' at the center for the future .
starting point is that calculation of <unk> , that people just about 23 years on the planet , and there .
of supercomputers -- called `` global <unk> <unk> '' , of course .
the call at the player , sign , we have almost like a `` <unk> '' <unk> designed .
you know the jerry <unk> , where it that `` <unk> '' there . they have the astronaut , the scientists , the <unk> and it together , they can save the world .
but in our ladders game , instead of only five million people , we say , everybody 's in <unk> , and it 's our job , the future for energy , food , health of security and the future of social justice to create .
8,000 , i played the game 's eight weeks .
they were 500 incredibly creative solutions , that they read , if you , `` <unk> '' google .
and the last game we bring the three . march out . it 's a game in collaboration with the world bank .
if you this game so , get them from the world bank , the distinction , `` social <unk> , '' the end by 2010 .
we 're working with the universities in all of sub-saharan africa , and they invite a , social construct our everyday .
we have a comic book on this . we have `` level up '' for <unk> understand , <unk> , sustainability , vision and his ingenuity .
i want you all invite men , this game with young people to share , the world , especially in <unk> , the of benefits , and their own social enterprises , to imagine , to the world to save .
i 'm now there .
i want you something questions .
what , you think , what happens when the next ?
we have all these fantastic players , we have games , the show us , we can do , but we have the real world still not be saved .
well , i hope , you to me in that i agree , that are human resources are , that we need to work in real life can use , and games to be a big meaning for change .
we 've all these superpowers , <unk> productivity , the ability , where social nets to knit , <unk> and the craving for <unk> meaning .
i really hope , that we put together in history play games , to double-click on this planet have a few examples of the 20th century to survive .
and i hope , they 're going to me to play , and play .
if i the next decade <unk> , i 'm at two things that 's safe , that we each <unk> future can make , and that we all kinds of play games .
so i say , let the <unk> 'll start !
thanks .
i 'd like to a little bit , what i 'm a few months ago , writing one article for <unk> wired noticed is .
i think about the writing , my <unk> fingertips , but i was playing with the kind of <unk> 've done , and i fell on , that i still never in my life <unk> have , what the word `` the disabled , '' really means .
i read them the post .

<unk> , healthy , strong , exquisitely sensitive . ''
i have this list of a friend says , reading and i had to find laughter , it seemed so ridiculous , but i was just to `` badly . '' and i could n't even more <unk> , and i had to stop to read and i 'll get to this <unk> <unk> and the with <unk> emotional shock .
obviously this was that a <unk> , old <unk> . i told me just thought , the copy , very old to be .
but actually it was a copy in the early 1980s , when i just with the school actually started and so began , my self outside of the family on building and to form , in terms of other children and the rest of the world to me around .
and god is very thankful i did n't <unk> used .
i would this post take seriously , i would have in a world was born , that someone like me as a person i would , whose lives in <unk> way we got a go through . today , but i 'm going to the opportunity and adventure , that i 've experienced , celebrated .
so i immediately the <unk> of 2009 navigated directly and expect , that i 'm here a <unk> 'll find .
here is the <unk> version of this <unk> .
unfortunately is they 're not much better .
especially to shake me the last two words , `` near <unk> '' `` . '' and `` healthy . ''
but it 's not just to the words .
it 's about , what we think about the people think , that we do with these words to describe .
it goes to the values , the in these words stuck , and how we these values , engineered .
our language affects our thinking and how we the world and the people to see around us .
many <unk> societies , including the greek and the roman , have really believed , the sounds of <unk> a great force has , because that , what you to <unk> , also <unk> .
so , what we want to actually <unk> -- a theirs are people , or a powerful people ?
just been a human <unk> as a child to call , could be enough , they 're not limit , and you have performances <unk> .
it would not nice , you doors to open up ?
a person , the for me out across has opened , was my pediatrician in the <unk> . chair dupont , the institute in <unk> in <unk> .
he is dr. <unk> . a <unk> , whose name , how do you see , the most americans are not accurate about it could . so he was always , dr. c.p .
and dr. p. was always very colorful , fly and was for the work with kids as simple .
i found the time , that i in that hospital , trying to have , just great -- until on my <unk> .
i had one that will be forever , often are living with these big fat , <unk> <unk> -- in different colors -- that you know , to my <unk> build . and i have this on down more being vilified as everything else . i did they hated it . i they felt crucified . i they hated it .
and ask you , i even have known as <unk> kid with dr. p. negotiate and so we 've tried , these exercise to stop , <unk> no success .
and one day , he has me in my favorite exercises at -- these sorts of it was really tiring and -- mercilessly , and he said to me , `` wow , <unk> , you 're like a strong , powerful and young girl , you 're going to one day one of on down whatsoever .
and if you get it says , i give you a hundred dollars . ''
of course that was just a lot easier to trick of dr. p. , so i the exercise will do , that i do n't do n't want , with the prospect , that the richest five-year-old girl in the ward in the second third floor . but he has made me in fact that brought , my daily <unk> with new eyes . so it became a new and <unk> experience .
and i wonder now , very his vision of me as strong and powerful tool that young girl with my self being formed , and i 'm so imagine being able to me as a kind of the strong , powerful and <unk> person in .
that 's just a sample of you , like adults in <unk> the comprehension of a child work .
but how the been quoted examples of the <unk> prove that makes us our language , no room , something to imagine , what we all want to , it every single entry to , to itself as powerful people in .
our language is behind the social changes who i think , the in many of a technology changes triggered by .
from a lot of the point out at the course , say , that my legs , the <unk> for <unk> , <unk> of titanium ; and it becomes <unk> , ranging body , that it allow people , really all their opportunities to use and wondering , over the borders , that you your natural , which he put it has , out to develop , not to speak of social <unk> platforms , people make a own identity , there , on their own way , and to define , and to start with the world to groups with , that you to itself , pick .
maybe we 're so this technological change and clear , because i ever , that 's always been one other inconvenient truth gave , which is , every man of society , something very <unk> and very powerful tool can give and that the human ability , to adapt , our biggest plus is .
the human ability to adapt yourself -- this is an interesting story , because people to me , and it 's ask to tell , i do with the odds , i deal , and i 'm going to be to confess , that sentence , has to me , never <unk> and i always very uncomfortable with it felt , the questions of people to answer , and i think , gradually i understanding why .
that sentence by interacting with tremendous odds that lives of the idea , that success or fortunately it depends on , a challenge to anybody coming , of , so on top experience of a cautionary note . as if my life so successful , it makes it , because i the kinds of one of life with a prosthetic limb of it could , like , always people to me with my disability as well .
but the truth is , we change . course , we are of the challenge of a designer , no matter whether you physically , emotional , or even the two is
and i thought that 's good .
odds are not an obstacle , that we <unk> have to with our lives better clear to come .
odds are easy to our lives .
and i tend to , gave , as my shadow .
sometimes i realize that he 's very close your mind is , sometimes it 's not likely to see , but he 's constantly morphing with me .
and i want to do n't , the impact , or obstruction . the heavy of <unk> of people to be degrading .
there 's in your odds , and challenges , and that are just <unk> real and each person 's about it differently . but the question is not , we going to be adversities , right now , or not , but how we realized that come .
so we 're not just responsible for , the people would we love , <unk> to keep , but they also to prepare , well , so clear to come .
and we maintain our kids do n't know , if we do you feel that there , to do n't want to discover .
you have to two things are dividing , for a the medical fact , an to be and the other the social something about this , if i as i 'm or not .
and to be honest , the only real and an disability , with the i just sit down to , is , the world are now , you can take me with these other definitions of .
in our desire , the people to protect , the us on the heart of you and you the cold , being the truth about their medical prediction , to report or even a forecast the quality to ask , that they expected , we have to pay attention , that we 're not the really made for a time , that somebody actually has helped them .
maybe this is where we concept , the only to pay attention , what 's in a broken , is , and how we the repair it , for every single one more profound disability than the pathology labs .
if we have a people do n't <unk> treat , and not all his evil forces and opportunity to sense , acknowledge , we do in addition to the natural struggle , you may lead to , one another disease .
we <unk> a human , the for our society , a value .
so we have over the <unk> look out and us on all of the human possibilities to focus .
the most important , but is , it between the perception of pushing and our great human ingenuity , a connection there .
we should those very challenging times is not <unk> or in denial , we should n't try , you to avoid , yet we need to give them under the carpet and return , but it 's about , in the odds of opportunity to recognize .
it 's me , maybe it 's more , clear to ask , that we gave , not necessarily need to get to , but that we started to open , are , you to hug , and make it really seize to put to also , a <unk> to use and maybe even to dance .
and maybe we do it , gave , as a natural , coherent and useful to see , and we feel like through their presence . that had .
the year in a celebration , we spend 200 of the . birthday of charles darwin and when he was 150 years ago about evolution has written , did darwin , in my eyes , on something very true in the human nature -- pointed out .
i would it 's so what , not the most of its way to survive , and also not the <unk> its way , but the , the to change the adapt .
of conflicts of creativity .
not only from darwin 's work , we know that the capacity to people , to survive and <unk> , the battle of human mind , certainly is actually , by conflict to turn .
so , again , change and these things are the great skills of people .
and maybe we know that , out of wood to people cherished are , if we really have to be .
maybe this is that the sense of the odds , a sense of these eyes , a feeling for our own power .
we can so even something like to give you .
we can be adversities , a new meaning , there , over the tough times beyond what about .
maybe we can be adversities , you see the change .
odds are for a change , at that we still not have adapted .
i think , the most of damage , we even in danger have , is to believe that we 're normal to be .
well , frankly -- who is normal ?
it is not normal .
there 's the usual . that . but not the normal . and they would those poor , the gray person who really know how we want , if you really there ?
i think , not .
it would be great , if we have this paradigm of normality , a different kind of the opportunity or the strength , to it even odder still a little bit dangerous to me restate that , they could . so we can the forces of very many kids who release , and you to invite men , their very particular , and those skills in the society in .
<unk> have what we found that we humans from the members of our society , one who claimed that have , to be and a contribution to afford .
there 's cues on , that have the neanderthals , 60,000 years older people and people with severe , physical injuries related to have worn away , and this was perhaps , because the life in <unk> these people for the society value was :
they have these people not as a broken and useless , it ; they were as something special , and really began to treat .
a few years ago , i went in the city , in the time i grew up was , in a <unk> in that `` the red zone . '' in the northeast of pennsylvania , and i was there with a <unk> tomatoes .
it was the summer , and i had <unk> .
and i am , as a guy behind me , `` well , if that 's not <unk> <unk> is . ''
and i turn , me to and see this whether her husband . i had no idea who he is .
and i said , `` sorry , sir , we know us ? i ca n't want to you remember . ''
and he said , `` well , they i mean , hardly at me remind .
when i told them for the first time i saw , i was led them from the belly of her mother got . ''
oh , so the .
and obviously has it , but then they click .
this was , dr. <unk> , a man , which i just from multiple narratives of my mother about this day i knew , because i think of course , very typical california , to my birthday , two weeks , too late to come .
the doctor for <unk> diagnostics of my mom was in on , so i knew my parents of the man , the me to the world to the government , all .
and because i without <unk> was born , and my feet , after them for you had and i just a couple of the toes , at this and a couple of the toes , the other foot did it was the <unk> , these strangers to the bad news in your book .
he said to me , `` i had to your parents say , that you never walk , would , and it 's never flexible , be would like the other children or that you never a completely independent life to run it could talk , and since they 've got me simply lying <unk> . ''
really exceptional , i found that he <unk> my entire childhood , except now has , no matter whether i at a <unk> in the second grade , won had , if i do with the <unk> at the mermaid parade to <unk> way discovered was , no matter whether i my transplant fellowship , or a friend of <unk> wins <unk> had , and he was using these clips , to his students to teach , <unk> from the <unk> medical school and the <unk> medical school .
and he called this part of his <unk> the x factor , the potential of mortality , willing .
you can just not enough to emphasize , how critical supplies of a factor for the quality of people could be .

you see , dr. <unk> has to think about changing .
he had understood , the medical diagnosis , and as someone to deal , two different things are .
and also i quit my thinking over the changed over time , if you me the age of 15 years , they were saying , if i mean who against the legs of meat and bone and switched have , i would have no one second <unk> .
i want to look at once have normal work .
if you this distresses me to ask , i 'm not sure .
and that 's happening , because i do something with my legs would have and not in spite of these experiences .
and perhaps could this in also happen , because i so many people in a while i am , the my door opened have , instead of people to encounter , the me to cut , or me an idea on to .
you see , it takes a really just a human , of them for , how they do <unk> can , and they 're going through .
if you it 's someone in the lives , his own , and forces and turn , -- the human mind is so <unk> -- if you do that , and for anyone in a critical moment a door busts open , then they 're looking for those people a very good teachers .
they bring them in , to itself out to open .
the real meaning of the word `` <unk> '' is rooted in the word `` <unk> . ''
it means , something to produce , that in this is , the potential <unk> .
again , what the potential to we , like ?
in the '60s , was in britain 's a <unk> done . when they were <unk> in <unk> transformed .
they call that there , `` music downloads <unk> '' in the u.s. , we call this as `` <unk> . ''
the students going to music , it .
and the a student will <unk> harder to have , the better teacher , etc .
they have then over a then period of students with a `` well enough . '' the top grade , `` very good '' there . it was told you , they were <unk> , that you very clever would be . and after these three months have you really <unk> .
and of course <unk> it in the heart to hear , that way around the <unk> been told , they were just enough .
and as it was then after the three months .
but only those , the still in the school were -- aside from the students , the school to be disciplined .
very crucial in this was that , the teachers wo n't <unk> .
the teachers wo n't know , that something changed .
you 've been just said , that 's the student and that are the students with the kind enough . and as you have you something about teaching and turn them .
the only really profound disability is a broken mind is a spirit , the broken by , has is hopeless . he find nothing more . he 's our natural , one of curiosity . and our innate capacity of imagination .
if we it , but i do , the human spirit and to support , continue to hope , to itself and other people to be wondering , around me because it to find , and <unk> to be then put things that we do n't really positive .
if a spirit of these qualities that , we can be a new reality and new <unk> do .
i want to a poem by saying , this one of persian poet named <unk> in 14 century . '' written by and of me my friend , frere jacques <unk> told . and the poem called `` the god , the only four words , there . '' `` every child knows , not the god the name , not the god of being banned , but the god , the only four words , there and these are repeated , he says , only : come , dance with me . ''
come , dance with me . thanks .
